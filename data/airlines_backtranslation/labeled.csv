0,LCY-BCN-LCY. on CE. I love LCY as you don't have to walk for miles. You come off the DLR down to the check in desk. Because we were flying Club Europe we were able to the use the dedicated check in desk so that was quick. Security was very quick and friendly. They seem to have even more security zones than my last trip. No lounges at LCY. Boarding was on time but no priority for CE pax or OW elites. However given as they board from the back and front of the plane it didn't mater. On board the 2 crew worked hard delivering the breakfast meals out to a full plane load. Nice product but the eggs were are bit crumbly. Arrived on time but bags took a while to come out with no priority. Return journey from BCN was good. Check in a breeze. Sala Miro lounge to wait in but being on the cusp of lunch there wasn't much in the way of fresh food about. Boarding was done by cabin/status. Not as full as before - 6 in CE only. Both meal options were salads ie fish or meat on rocket with some other little bits. Could have done with more leaves and some vegetables! Dessert was some cream concoction imitating an Eton mess. The crew were good and even offered their meal to a pax that didn't fancy the options. Bags at City came out in some order ie some priority bags then standard then a few more priority. Still a quick airport to exit. Shame BA is cancelling the LCY - BCN flights from August. I hope they bring them back.,1,"LCY-BCN-LCY. on CE. I love LCY because you don't have to walk miles. You will be taken from the DLR to the check-in desk. As we were flying with Club Europe, we were able to use the special check-in desk, so it was quick. Security was very fast and friendly. They seem to have even more security zones than my last trip. No lounges at LCY. The boarding school was on time, but for the CE-Pax or OW elites it was not a priority. But when you think they're getting on the plane from behind and in front, it doesn't matter. On board, the two crew members worked hard to deliver breakfast meals until the plane was fully loaded. Nice product, but the eggs were a bit crumbly. Arriving on time, it took a while for the bags to come out without priority. The return trip from BCN was good. Check in a snap. Sala Miro Lounge to wait for, but since we were about to have lunch, there was not much fresh food."
1,On the flight to Dubai we wanted to Fly Business Class but unfortunately all Business Class and First Class seats were booked - so we booked Economy Class on the A380. This was the best Economy Class experience we have had the seats are wide with a lot leg room.

2,"Flew 2 legs- MID-MEX on ""Connect"" brand and then MEX-YYZ. The MID-MEX leg was operated by an E190 no IFE and the snacks were average peanuts but the seats were comfortable and due to the length of the flight it wasn't important. The second leg was on a 737-700. The seats were comfortable and very nice blankets were provided however the IFE was quite limited (overhead screens that played movies and nothing else and were shut off 3 quarters into the flight) so I would recommend bringing your own entertainment if you're flying an Aeromexico 737. In flight meal was edible at most. Overall there were no major problems but they need to improve their IFE on longer flights and their food.",1,"Flies 2 legs - MID-MEX on ""Connect"" mark and then MEX-YYZ.

3,DOH-MCT-BKK outbound and return. DOH-MCT on E175 superb seating friendly and professional crew. MCT- BKK there was a change of aircraft (plane was a Gulf Air wetlease - does not compare to WY cabin though service was friendly). Business Class Lounge in MCT is outstanding with friendly staff and excellent selection. On return BKK WY lounge was excellent staff did check-in for me to save the hassle of the transfer desk lounge was busy but enough comfortable seating. Staff were responsive to requests and provided a great service. Transfer in MCT again easy. Was only J passenger on MCT-DOH cabin and impressed that WY organised a special J bus to collect me and to take me to the terminal. Was in the office less than 40 mins after landing.,1,"DOH-MCT-BKK return flight. DOH-MCT on E175 excellent seating friendly and professional crew.

4,My first Allegiant Air experience. I booked two weeks in advance. Traveled from LAX to Idaho Falls. I go to Jackson Hole WY every summer and I always have to get creative about getting there as there are always high ticket prices. I decided to give this airline a go. Both flights were on time - every aspect was fine. Yes it is no-frills and you pay for everything but if you know that going in you can adapt. We became better packers and brought our own food onboard.,1,"My first Allegiant Air experience. I booked two weeks in advance. Traveled from LAX to Idaho Falls.

5,It was our first time flying with Norwegian and after reading some of the comments I was quite anxious. I was flying with my little boy and was worried more about his comfort on this long flight. On arrival at Gatwick airport we checked in promptly most of the staff were nice enough. The flight arrived on time and we were allowed to board. The plane was very modern and clean and the entertainment provided was excellent. With so many films games music and activities available free of charge I didn't need to have packed onboard activities for my son. Food service was prompt and was to a good standard as plane food goes it better then any other airline I have used. The flight was smooth and we were kept fully updated and arrived at out destination on time. The only thing I would say is to purchase snacks at the airport at the selection of food and drink from the snack bar isn't great also I didn't like the fact you can only make purchases using a debit/credit card!,1,"It was our first time flying with Norwegian and after reading some comments I was quite concerned.

8,"We got an offer for 500GBP per person at last minute. The plane from London to Bahrain was awful - delayed boarding. Crew were unkind. The food was served late, even after many requests for some snacks (my kids got hungry), the crew didn't manage to give anything. There were no vegetarian options left. The entertainment was cut off during half the flight. However, once in Bahrain everything went smoothly. The check-in was delightful. The crew were very pleasant and the flights were on time.

12,"Yesterday January 19 2015 I flew Flight 16 from Seattle back to Orlando. It had been a round-about 48 hour visit to an ill relative and I was exhausted from having to rise in the wee hours AM to board coming and going on the only non-stop flight. It has been many years since I have seen flight attendants so ""up-beat"" and kind with a sense of humor in the face of a fully packed jumbo jet. And too many years since I have seen well-groomed stewardesses actively caring for each passenger.

13,What can I say about long haul KLM? A true tale of extremes: Pros: Value for money (only £560 return ABZ-SIN via AMS). Lounge at AMS (free food drinks wifi and showers via Petroleum Card). Food and Beverage onboard was to a surprisingly good standard for economy airline food and freely available. Staff were attentive and helpful. Cons: Seat didn't recline anywhere near as much as it does in any other airline Ive flown with and felt really cramped - I found this odd given the Dutch are the tallest in the world! IFE was so dated and a limited poor selection of music films and TV. Cabin decor is dull. All in all not too bad but the cons niggled away at me.,1,"What can I say about KLM?

14,We flew from Las Vegas to Honolulu on March 27 2014. Flight to Honolulu had no problems or issues at all it was on time and everything went smoothly at the airport. Follow their luggage guidelines and check in online and you won't have any problems. Flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas was delayed 4 hours 15 minutes but they did give each person in my family $16 in food vouchers to use at the airport the problem was because of the delay we missed our shuttle from the Las Vegas airport to the parking garage where our car was. When I asked an Allegiant employee for some suggestions she just said I would have to get a taxi. When I checked in online 24 hours in advance for our flight home I was able to check everybody in except for myself (we had 10 people total). I tried to check myself in online a few hours later and it worked fine I just didn't get to sit by my family during the flight. There is no inflight movie so bring something to do. The seats are super small and there is not much room. No food or drink not even water is given unless you pay for it with visa only no cash. We got extremely affordable flights to Hawaii and otherwise would not have been able to go if it weren't for price Allegiant offered. You give up luxury and service for affordable pricing which I think is fair.,1,"We flew from Las Vegas to Honolulu on March 27, 2014.

18,I flew Venice-Frankfurt-Delhi on December 28. Initial flight was supposed to be a day earlier so I missed my connection in FRA and was put on a Lufthansa flight to Delhi rather than Air India which was nice. VCE-FRA was delayed by 2hours and I only managed to make it because FRA-DEL was also delayed. FRA airport although I was there for less than an hour was an atrocious experience. I had to speed like crazy to make the flight and still had to go through security one more time and they were extremely rude unprofessional and in no way understanding. This is surely not Lufthansa's fault but it did ruin my trip. Flight to Delhi was on their A380 which I adore. Leg room was fair food was decent although they only had vegetarian options. FAs were extremely polite and professional and always asked if we wanted any drinks throughout the flight. My issue was mostly related to IFE which was not what I expected from LH.

Nothing to complain about flight was on time on board service in general was good however the only point I can complain about is that breakfast could have been better.

34,I flew from Jakarta to Sydney in Business Class and it was fantastic! The cabin seat food and flight attendants were world class.

36,Have made 5 flights this year with Jet2 mainly LBA - AGP. Last flight out had to turn round due to cracked windscreen. No problems just swapped to another plane at LBA. All flights have been very close to being on time with the exception of the last flight we were only 3 hrs late after all the problems.

37,Beijing to Shenzhen on A340-600. Seat was a lie flat business class seat with AVOD and came with a duvet and proper cushion. The cabin was showing its age somewhat. The meal was very good. I chose the western main and it was very good. Departures from Beijing are from Terminal 1 flight delayed 90 minutes.

39,Flew NH1 (IAD-NRT) 2143 (NRT-FUK) 2 (NRT-IAD). I was very satisfied with my experience aboard ANA. It was my second trip with them and the services had changed slightly. Ground-side staff were polite and efficient including at Narita where representatives gave clear directions for rechecking baggage following Customs. Some airside amenities had changed since my previous trip in 1/09. Things like ice cream were no longer free after meals instead at the time they had an a la carte menu from which you could order business class treats like sake or udon for a modest fee. The udon was fantastic for a midnight snack. I had a special meal (vegetarian) registered and cabin crew served those first (which I guess was awkward for folks like me) but they indeed arrived vegetarian as advertised. IFE was stocked with a good mix of fairly recent western and Japanese films television shows and music. I seldom felt the need to turn to my iPod. Seats were comfortable and pitched well enough for this average-sized American male. Fukuoka connection: I wasn't awake for a lot of the flight but we were provided light beverages.

48,"We were supposed to fly LPB-SRE in mid-July but a blockade on the road caused us (and quite a few others) to miss our flight. We went to the BOA office in La Paz and were able to rebook without change fees. Only paid the fare difference. Finally flew out on the 18th but had a several hour delay out of La Paz. While this was not handled all that well by the ground staff this seemed to be par for the course - every other flight we have been on this year (in the USA) has had delays. Boarding was easy. Once the flight was announced, everyone just lined up and boarded. None of the convuluted boarding typical of airlines in the US and it only took about 15 minutes to board the plane. Since checked bags are free, there was no hassle for overhead space. Plane was economy class only with decent seat pitch. No extra charge to choose seats. Despite being a short flight, cabin crew came around with a complementary snack box and beverages. Plane was an older 737 but in reasonable shape and clean - I have flown in much more dilapidated planes on the legacy carriers. We had made a mistake on our booking for the return but were able to call BOA and rebook for the next day. Again, only paid the fare difference, in this case about US$8 each. Return flights (with connection in Cochabamba) were on time and the crew managed a snack service with drinks on the 35 minute flight from Cochabamba to La Paz. On the shorter flight from Sucre to Cochabamba they handed out snack packs to everyone. All in all a very good experience. Crews and ground staff generally pleasant and efficient.

49,I flew with Scoot last month to Singapore we had booked into economy class and upgraded to the nicer seats.

61,Rome to Bangkok via Colombo July 13th. Business class. Check in was quick and easy. Given a priority pass for security but everyone has to face the same endless queues for immigration. Had asked about a wheelchair for my elderly partner. We had booked the service for disabled passengers at Rome airport but it is quite understaffed so we chose not to worry about it.

AVOD was good, but they need to add more current movies and music. The AVOD was also sometimes unresponsive with its touchscreen system, which made operation difficult. I would suggest that they subtitle their films in Indonesian so that every passenger can enjoy the films on offer. Overall, I am very satisfied with their service and would love to fly them again."
64,LH460 12/16/2014. It was very cold in the cabin during the flight. The plane was very noisy. The seats were uncomfortable - the upper part of it pushed the head uncomfortably forward.

65,My wife and I flew with KLM from London to Amsterdam and then on to Aruba in September. Our outgoing flights were outstanding. Good food good entertainment and good staff we could not be more pleased. However our return flight was the opposite food was extremely poor seen very little of the staff but the entertainment was ok. I fail to understand how an airline can achieve the two extremes in a very short space of time. KLM showed us that the airline has the potential to be outstanding but appears to have continuity issues.,1,"My wife and I flew with KLM from London to Amsterdam and on to Aruba in September.

66,I have to say that whilst everyone likes to moan about airlines my recent flight with Delta was great on their services from/to LHR-JFK. The food was also excellent on the outward flight being a vegetarian I requested a special meal and was served minted peas with wild rice and marinated tofu along with a bread roll cheese and crackers and a dessert. Then just before landing we were served Calzone. They certainly don't let you go hungry! On the return journey however the main dish was pasted and vegetables which wasn't to my liking at all but it was a late night flight and I wasn't particularly hungry anyway breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. The only gripes I have are that the leg room is cramped - but where isn't it these days! With regard to the on board entertainment whilst having an excellent selection of content was somewhat slow and sluggish and even required re-starting on the return flight. On the ground baggage arrived promptly and check in was also efficient at both airports with staff being courteous and professional. Both flights left before the scheduled departure time and arrived well before their scheduled arrival time in both cases even though on the outward flight there was a delay in passengers boarding. For the price it was truly excellent.,1,"I must say that, while everyone likes to moan about airlines, my last flight with Delta on their services to / from LHR-JFK was great.

Shortly before landing we were served with Calzone. They certainly will not leave you hungry! On the way back, however, the main course was glued in and vegetables I did not like at all, but it was a late-night flight and I was not particularly hungry anyway. Breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. I just feel like the legroom is tight - but where is it not these days? As for on-board entertainment, the choice of content was a bit slow and slow, and even required a reboot on the return flight.

67,XIY-ICN-CDG last week. The first leg was onboard a 13-year old A333. Flight was on-time food was acceptable and service impeccable. The second leg was on a new A380. Unfortunately the check-in systems do not work for people from outside Korea and hence I got an aisle seat. This was disappointing as 99% of the time I sit by a window. It was interesting to note that the past month the flight had been 40-60 min delayed every day from ICN while arriving on time at CDG most of the time. The same happened to us and I learned that was because of heavy congestion at the airport. This should be fixed if you ask me. The flight itself was very smooth food was great and enough to drink. I'm surprised that they are a bit cheap on drinks not giving a can of soft drink but just a glass. Makes you feel less worth in many ways. Smooth landing at CDG was nice.,1,"XIY-ICN-CDG last week.

68,MEK-KUL. We booked the extra legroom seats in Row 7. Great seats and we were amongst the first passengers to embark and exit. We enjoyed very tasty Nasi Lemak meal. Service requests very promptly answered by cabin crew. A tip for any couple flying in the Row 7 seats: Try to get a seat either side of the aisle as it is less comfortable in the middle seat of 3 with the narrow armrests. We also flew Air Asia from KUL-PEN and PEN-SIN. Both flights were on time. Paying the small extra fee for Row 1 seats ensured we were first on and first off and had extra legroom.,1,"MEK-KUL.

69,I have used KLM several times now and reasonably pleased with the service provided. The entertainment system has a long list of good movies and seat comfort is good even with my glass back though it could improve with the addition of a foot rest. An extra tour with the beverage trolley would be nice on long-haul flights but you can always buzz if necessary. Planes are always clean and tidy. Cabin staff are pleasant.

70,JER-GCI-JER-LCY. Inter-island flights on a little Jetstream. Only 10 mins each way but good fun. With the open cabin and no door to the flight deck it really gave an insight into what the flight crew do. Far from trans-continental business class that I often fly but in many ways this was a lot more enjoyable. The lounges for all passengers are a nice touch but some air con in Jersey would be good. Timetable seems to not be completely thought through for connections (eg 1hr 30 wait in Jersey for flight to LCY). Would like to see a GCI-LCY direct flight added or better connections to the JER-LCY flight so that a LCY-GCI trip can be done in a day. All in all though a very good experience that I would happily repeat.,1,"JER-GCI-JER-LCY. Flights between the islands on a small jet stream. Only 10 minutes each way, but lots of fun.

71,Newish planes with excellent comfort. Can supply quality meals and cater for food intolerances something other carriers like Turkish and Emirates cant (in my experience). Cabin service excellent.

77,"My return flight to the UK from Bordeaux was not as good as going out. Largely due to the chaotic nature of Bordeaux airport. This involved a cattle like holding area for passengers waiting to board the flight. We were held there for ages before being allowed onto the plane and it was really uncomfortable with nowhere to sit and a single file queueing area in place. Once onboard the flight was very busy. The cabin crew did a good job really, especially as there were one or two disruptive passengers on board who were pretty rude to one flight attendant in particular. Other than that, the flight went very quickly. I was going to get something from the in-flight service, having not been able to pick something up at the airport, but it was slow coming round (despite the fact I was only in row 9) so we were making our descent by the time they got to me.",1,"My flight back to the UK from Bordeaux was not as good as going out.

Meals served on JFK leg were great. Seats are spacious with plenty of legroom for people under 6 ft tall. However seat back is very thick and the seat in front of you somewhat crowds into you. IFE was fine but needs improvement in variety. This airline really needs to focus on improving the command in English for the entire crew. Public announcements in English were poor.

100,Luton-Bodrum. Flight on time fast check-in. It was a 3x3 configuration and asked for an aisle seat and told we'd have to sit adjacent both on the aisle (no different to other budget airlines). Glad we did that on this airline as there's no doubt in my mind that the seat pitch is one of the smallest for a budget airline. Width OK but neither of us is remotely tall yet the pocket on the seat in front was brushing my knees even when empty of the things I usually stuff in it! Seemed quite claustrophobic for those by the window and middle worse if the seat in front gets tipped back. Plane in good condition clean and everything that was supposed to work was working. Cabin staff a trifle remote - is smiling banned? Tin of Coke cost £2.70 and assume everything else was expensive too. Followed advice on this site and took our own drinks/snacks. Inbound comments a week later would be the same as those above asked for 2 aisle seats and got them but passengers behind us not so lucky. Stewardesses smiled a bit more this time. During turbulence they walked down the aisle halfheartedly checking seatbelts were done up but weren't bothered if they couldn't actually see. Both directions they seem to get the luggage off fast - assume quick 'turnaround' required. Safety briefings in English. All in all I'd use them again though not necessarily as my first 'budget' choice - need another couple of inches between me and the seat in front.,1,"Luton-Bodrum. Punctual flight, fast check-in.

I had only one really bad flight that was delayed for about 4 hours but that was the worst of it. There are no ""middle seats"" as the configuration is 2 and 2 and there are no carts - the flight attendants use baskets of chips and put the soft drinks in the pockets of their apron. I like that.

New male wash bag is a laugh so I asked for the female wash bag which actually is slightly better. Flight got very cold and I asked for an extra blanket.

126,I travelled from Brisbane to Perth with Qantas on their upgraded 767-338 and was pleased to see that the ethics of Australia's only real full service carrier have been upheld. On this aircraft each passenger was supplied with an Apple IPad which connects to the Wi-Fi onboard the aircraft and streams a variety of entertainment. We were served lunch on this flight and I was very happy with my meal choice. The crew were polite and attentive throughout the flight and came through the cabin frequently to make sure all passengers were comfortable.

136,AC 811 from IST to YYZ on B767-300. The ground services in Istanbul are handled by a third party for Air Canada and are appalling. I am a top-tier AC frequent flyer and used the priority check-in which took an extraordinarily long time to process our party of 4 travellers. There were 5 agents behind the desk with only one dealing with the passengers and the rest simply watching. Boarding process was utterly chaotic with 9 agents in attendance and none of them at all interested in answering the queries from the passengers or helping them. I had to inquire 3 times about priority boarding before I was offered a snippy response. In one of those instances the agent made eye-contact and then simply walked away from me completely ignoring my question. The gate assigned for the flight was woefully inadequate to handle a Transatlantic flight. 200+ passengers were processed through a check-in facility more suited for commuter planes. We were eventually bussed to the aircraft adding further delays to a flight that was already delayed by 90 minutes. Once onboard the aircraft showed its age with tired interior worn-out PODS inoperable washrooms and dull lighting. FA's were very attentive and the AVOD selection offered plenty of options. Two meals and frequent water-runs were offered throughout the 11-hour long flight. The meals were mediocre at best but drink selection was good. The only redeeming aspect of the journey was the amazing Business Lounge operated by Turkish Airlines. The flight arrived late but we were lucky to make our connection.

The question is whether the new equipment on the SYD routes will be seasonal or permanent, as I will definitely fly them from Sydney much more frequently if it is the latter. Highly recommended airline."

Travelled to Guam on an A330-300 which was well equipped with newer personal video-on-demand system and comfortable seats but return trip to Incheon on an old B747-400 was much less comfortable with terrible breakfast.

157,My husband and I flew round trip from Boston MA to West Palm Beach FLA. Return leg worked very well because we requested aisle seats which gave him a little more leg room. He is 6ft tall and was extremely uncomfortable in a middle seat going down. Coming home a very pleasant Spirit check in person suggested 2 aisle seats. I would definitely fly Spirit again. Didn't buy any extras because they were unnecessary. It was only a 3 hr. flight.

158,"Nice new A321 aircraft, friendly crew, flight on time - short 1 hour 20 minute flight. The aircraft had overhead screens but they were only really used for the safety video (which curiously they only do in English and then ask passengers who speak one of their three main languages to ask the crew if they have questions). Strange croissant with a pretzel coating (but in my past experience Swiss food is not nice, even in business) and wide selection of drinks including alcohol. I had flown out on Austrian and the quality of Swiss is just a couple of notches higher. I did check in online but the Swiss website sends you to Lufthansa for some reason. Automatic check-in is a nice touch but their app remains awful as you have to re-login each time you switch app to access your boarding pass.",1,"Nice new A321 aircraft, friendly crew, punctual flight - short flight of 1 hour and 20 minutes.

162,Travelled to Cancun from Gatwick on 1st August and returned 11th August. Both ways on the Dreamliner. Flew out on G-TUIE on the way there. On the way back we were on Dream Maker (G-TUIC). Premium is not worth the hike in price. We were sat 2 rows behind premium both ways in economy in extra space seats and they were just as good. I guess premium gets better cutlery and dishes slightly larger TV screen but that's it. The flights themselves were fantastic so smooth. The inflight entertainment was great wide variety of choice along with games too. Tip for people who want to sleep it wasn't until we landed coming back that we realised you could bend the headrest round your head! Might've helped if the cabin crew make everyone aware of what does what when they're sat down. I ended up with such a crick in my neck from sleeping in an awkward position with the unfluffiest pillow. Food going to Cancun was great. The Lily Obrien salted caramel chocolate mousse was to die for! And then to have 'afternoon tea' shortly before landing was a nice touch. Coming back was a different story. The food was mainly dry the bread roll was stale and like cardboard the dessert looked and tasted very artificial. Considering the flight back is almost 9 hours long there was a gap of 6 odd hours where the cabin crew didn't bother coming up and down the aisles anymore to see if anyone wanted anything. We had dinner shortly after take off and then an hour before landing we were served breakfast. I guess because it's a night flight they don't want to be disturbing people however I was so hungry! Guess I could've called them but they seem quite unapproachable. I'm a lover of Starbucks coffee so to see this on the menu was great. The pilots were great at keeping us informed.,1,"He travelled from Gatwick to Cancun on 1 August and returned on 11 August. Both on the Dreamliner. On the way there he flew out with G-TUIE.

167,August 29 from São Paulo to Paris. Boeing 777-300 - (F-GSQI). Ticket was purchased directly on the website on May 2. However seat assignment was not permitted as long as the passenger makes the check in online 30 hours prior the departure. I definitely can't say that I agree with such procedure but it's a way to force passengers to do their own check in. Online check-in went fine but I was previously informed by the AF reservation agent that all seats would be available once the system was charged but definitely this was untrue. Anyhow I got seats together for myself and my parents. Once onboard the aircraft was with an issue with the air-conditioning system. So the plane was hot just like a sauna. Only when the main door was closed and the engines started working fortunately we got fresh air. Flight was completely full. As soon as we took off crew started the inflight service. Eyeshade and earphones were personally distributed which was a nice touch. Right after welcome drink which included champagne and a small bag of salty snacks were offered.

172,SQ912 SIN-MNL 13/3/2014. Trip was on a refitted B777-200ER registration 9V-SVG. Actual time inflight was 3hrs 5mins. There was a delay in moving off but captain kept passengers well informed. Service was fantastic as usual better than on the return leg since crew were still fresh from rest. Drinks service was basic and I still prefer a full drinks cart being pushed out rather than a tray of juices water beer and white wine. Food was so-so. Had a choice between braised beef with fried rice and fish with potatoes. I had fish while my companion had the beef. My fish dish was disappointing with not much taste to the fish. Vegetables tasted fine. Starter was a bit on the dry side. Dessert was heavenly. My companion said the beef tasted good. Other than that I asked for 3 cocktails and all of which were honoured with a smile. They didn't seem to think of this as a chore. Cabin crew were helpful and joked with some passengers.

Seat wasn't super comfortable and there wasn't loads of leg room, but with the blanket provided it was survivable. For the cheapest option around, that's all I had hoped for.

184,Mumbai to Kolkata. Plane at gate on time but apparently staff were not! After 30 minutes without any information the Indian passengers started to complain. Within minutes the complaints turned into loud shouting. Whatever was shouted produce results because the gate opened almost immediately. Full flight.

Even on that short flight (around 50mins) we got offered a drink and a snack (Lindt chocolate or crisps). At leaving the airplane we got Air Berlin chocolate- hearts. The flight back was excellent too. The online check-in worked and the flight was perfectly on time. Very friendly staff and good service again. The flight attendant accidentally spilled a drop of coffee because of turbulence. She gave me two more chocolates as excuse which I found very kind.

190,We travelled from KUL-ALA-LHR-ALA-KUL earlier this month. We were very pleasantly surprised by the high standard of service and attention given by the cabin crew on all sectors. The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!). Quality of onboard food out of Almaty was a bit iffy however understood when one takes into account one is in Central Asia. This airline is a little gem and excellent value for money.,1,"We arrived from KUL-ALA-LHR-ALA-KUL at the beginning of the month.

191,I chose them simply because they were by far the cheapest. I flew LA-Nadi-Sydney this morning: although this meant a nearly 4hour layover in Fiji it was actually the same 747 which took me the whole way. Check in was quick and friendly (even Tom Bradley operated favourably for me!) and my first impression of the cabin was that I liked the colour - somewhere between lilac and purple. I had no problems with the seats (although I did have a very large person sitting next to me on the second leg who kind of spilled into me I fixed that by moving) and they seemed to recline as much as any do. Dinner was fine the coffee actually tasted better than any other airline coffee I've had. Beer was freely available. I knew that breakfast would not be great but I don't really eat breakfast anyway. I also knew the IFE was old so came prepared. But the crew were the stars - full of good humour. Air Pacific is re-branding and has 3 new planes arriving this year one in March so grumbles about the 747 will soon be redundant.,1,"I chose them simply because they were by far the cheapest.

195,LHR-EZE via GRU out and GIG back. Best price I found for route with short connections. I thought legroom reasonable for economy. Food OK on long haul but the dry cheese and ham roll on connecting flights a let down. Entertainment good - mix of new releases and good older films. Re comments about FAs - right or wrong I have found on all South America routes you are expected to go and get any nuts drinks snacks etc from them works like a bar. They were helpful with warm milk for the kids and moving our seats on the way back (arm rests wouldn't lift up for kids to sleep).

198,PER-SYD-PER Easter long weekend. Both flights A330-200. A330 for the flight to Sydney had a broken APU so had no ground air conditioning until engines started. It was a sauna until 20 minutes into the flight. Obviously old video system individual screens but continuous loop (not AVOD) with poor vision and sound. Food OK and complimentary beer/wine. Return flight much newer A330 with good AVOD. Once again food fine and sufficient along with beer/wine. Significantly less legroom on this aircraft. Check-in for both flights was OK despite being busy days but check-in staff could show some enthusiasm for the job or find another one. The biggest disappointment was the lack of even a casual smile from any of the cabin crew except when first entering each aircraft. After that it was glum faces for the entire flight. The odd smile makes the journey go so much better for both passengers and crew. I normally fly QF but gave VA a go this time based not only on price/schedule but also looking for an alternative to QF for regular travel needs.

200,AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS. Overall I was impressed by the aircraft (especially the amount of space in the A380) entertainment and catering. The crew however in my opinion delivered a very inconsistent service along the different flights. In general the welcome during boarding was excellent personal and warm. But then the crew members differed so much that I was puzzled. Some really were excellent did lot's of extras to make you feel a welcome guest. The other half however in my opinion was either rushed tired did not reply to call button at all. No apologies/no sign of human contact were made at all on the long MEL-DXB flight after forgetting two rows on meal service not replying to call button buttons forgetting to hand out drinks ordered. It really was an accumulation of mistakes that can happen but the handling of it made me unhappy. All in all I will fly them again for the comfortable product they offer but I have tempered my expectations for the overall face to face contact during the flights which in my opinion weigh heavily.,1,"AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS.

204,MAN-PMI-MAN. Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for £200 per person in low season.,1,"MAN-PMI-MAN.

The night flight on the outward leg was only half full which made a quick Service possible and I could sleep in an empty middle row.

Perhaps the competition on this regular route, including the new Vistara Airlines Air India, will keep them on their toes and they will have to make even more efforts to hold back their loyal customers."

215,I have flown Jet Airways on six separate return trips within the past twelve months back and forth between Toronto-Brussels-Delhi-Kathmandu in Business Class except for 4 of the 24 legs involved. Every flight left on schedule and most of them landed ahead of scheduled time. This airline operates like clockwork. It is very reliable. Baggage handling has also been very reliable - even through Delhi because it is in the hands of the one airline and they apparently make sure bags are transferred when they should be.

The seat itself was great and comfortable the cabin layout was modern and clean however I found out that the cabin crew seemed to be inconsistent.

221,Of all my recent experiences flying LHR-MEL I would consider Royal Brunei to be the best. The cabin crew were genuine and attentive and being there for passengers was their primary focus throughout the flight. A big selling point was the additional seat pitch giving a sense of space and comfort. The recline was good. The entertainment system worked perfectly well. Meals were of similar quality to other carriers however were a little more generous than the offerings of some others and a lot more generous than those offered by BA and VS. Check in was simple and efficient in both directions and travelling through Brunei Airport was a joy. Small quiet no ridiculous long distances to navigate and not daunting in any way. I also prefer having two stops (3 x 7hr legs) between the UK and Australia as being in the air for 14 hours on the now standard 1x7 + 1x14 hour leg is nothing short of horrific.

The snack box offered and its contents are just poor the only reason for paying the surcharge called ""smart price"" is preselected seating and one piece of checked in luggage. The general quality of service is acceptable - friendly crew efficient service clean planes plus the feeling of safety/security you buy in a plane of the Lufthansa group.

250,BKK-LHR. Written from the perspective of someone who for the last few years has only used EVA Business Class. Very fast check in at Bangkok the EVA lounge at Bangkok is well furnished and with an ample supply of food and drink. The flight itself was 10 minutes late departing but the time was made up during the flight and we arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule. The meals were satisfactory and well presented with never ending refills of tea or coffee a range of soft drinks were available throughout the flight. There was also a mid flight snack of rolls and sandwiches served during the flight and water and juice were offered every hour or at the touch of a button from the cabin attendants. The cabin crew were excellent with a good level of English and as I have always found with EVA pleasant and convivial. During the flight a passenger required the assistance of a doctor and the cabin crew dealt with the emergency in a very professional and calm manner. The seat legroom was good (I am over 6 ft tall) my only problem with the seats is that they do not recline enough for me to be fully comfortable but that is probably my Business Class travel being my expectation. I didn't use the IFE as I use my IPad but there was a good selection of movies and my travel companions' IFE were in use throughout the flight with no complaints. The toilets were kept spotless during the flight with a good supply if toiletries. It would be nice if Heathrow used two air bridges for unloading as the time taken to offload 300+ passengers at the furthest gate from Immigration plus the long walk from Gate 35 after a 12 hour flight is unwelcome but that just like the meltdown of the Immigration system at Heathrow is not under EVA's control.,1,"BKK-LHR.

254,I had the pleasure of the new A380 flying LAX-ICN connecting to an A330 for ICN-BKK. I was upstairs in Travel Class (Economy) and would have to rate the experience as the best of all my Economy Class flights over a million miles of travel. The new design seats are plenty comfortable enough especially when the redesign generated another inch or so of legroom (via thinner back cushioning). The crew was the usual Asiana well-oiled and very attentive machine and everything went off without the slightest hitch. The in-flight entertainment is presented on a beautiful 10-inch touch screen but it could have benefited from a broader range of offerings as is found on Cathay Pacific Singapore Airlines and other competitors in the region. It is a minor complaint though given the amazing quiet and smoothness of the A380 ride.

The hot meal service started about 1 hr into this 1.5 hr flight. Even then service was slow and by the time this service reached Row 2 where I was sat we were well into the descent and the service was withdrawn.

265,"Being the first time flying with QantasLink, I was eager to see how standards compared with big brother Qantas. Airport Check In and security was all smooth through Brisbane. It was once I stepped on board that I noticed me and my colleague had the worst seats possible on the plane.

In addition to this the Boeing 717 has tail mounted engines which made the flight quite noisy - especially when trying to talk or listen to the cabin crew.

Cabin Crew were constantly looking to top up water. No IFE made the 3 and bit hour journey drag on - considering we had read that iPads were offered on this aircraft?

270,Flew Bangkok to Copenhagen on A340 recently. Granted A340s are relatively new the business class seats seem to age already. The position adjuster is hard to use and one can never adjust individual segments such as recline or leg-rest. Everything was linked. If one wants to recline the leg-rest retracts first so one must raise one's legs slightly first. Rather odd. Video selection is way too thin for a long haul flight. Compared to what Singapore or ANA are offering in the same class the seats seem antiquated. SAS also has the odd rule of not allowing blankets on or shoes off during take off and landing. So after a good snooze the cabin crew yanks the blanket off 30 minutes prior to landing. A rather rude way to wake up. I miss Air New Zealand which allows the same class full recline during landing.,1,"Flights recently from Bangkok to Copenhagen with the A340.

But they offered a bottle of water.

273,I fly Bangkok Airways frequently between Chiang Mai and Bangkok and back. I have always been impressed by this airline's service and attention to detail. BKK Air's lounges both in CNX and BKK are being renovated and they have immediately set up temporary make-shift lounges at both airports. Moreover the airline is the only one that I know of that offers snacks tea/coffee/water - pretty good coffee ample seating Internet. WiFi to its economy class passengers.

283,"BOS-CDG, overnight flight on the 11th July and code-shared with Air France. Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra £50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate, although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy.

284,SIN-DVO. Flight to Davao departed 30mins late. Immigration cards were distributed in the airport and it was quite chaotic. The baggage collection was messy as the airport's conveyor belt was too short for all the luggage and some had to be manually carried out by airport staff. Seat was okay for an almost 4hour flight. The return trip was fantastic. Left on time and arrived in Singapore 30mins before scheduled. Very friendly FA's. They use the tube to/from the aircraft at Davao instead of the stairs.

Although it wasn't so close to me I appreciated how they took the extra time to make me feel comfortable. When I was in CPH however there seemed to be a problem with me entering the lounge as usually one can just go through the automated gate but they needed to ask me to go to the side and scan my boarding pass and mileage card. A minor inconvenience but what irked me about this was that the staff member seemed annoyed to have to check my lounge access rights (with me of course still entering the lounge but just a few worried minutes later than usual).,1,"HEL-CPH-LHR, on my first flight I was actually a bit unlucky (a child threw away a few seats in my row) and the flight crew was happy to take me to Premium Economy Class, as this happened during boarding.

286,My husband and I flew from Berlin to Toronto via Brussels and return.

287,Return trip Stockholm-Copenhagen Sep 25 2013 (SAS Plus) for a short business meeting in Copenhagen. Everything was very smooth and efficient and the staff were very friendly as always. The airplanes on this trip were Airbus A320 and A321. The A320 though not new had a fresh interior but was equipped with the dreadful budget Recaro seats that feels sitting on your local bus. The SAS A320s are not equipped with any overhead monitors. On the way back to Stockholm I travelled with the A321 quite similar but equipped with overhead monitors. The A321 is also equipped with Recaro seats but with slightly better padding but obviously worn since they have been around for some years by now. Generally the trip was good mostly thanks to the very professional and friendly staff. The level of service offered in SAS Plus (Business Class) is however not what would be expected from this generally well-renowned airline.

297,I booked my flight from Rome to Los Angeles with Air Canada which I have flown with before and enjoyed. It was not until I received my booking confirmation that I realized that the first leg of the trip (Rome to Montreal) was with Rouge and the second leg (Montreal to LA) was with regular AC. After having already committed I checked the reviews for Rouge and became startled. All of the negative comments had me dreading the trip. It is a long flight and to be cramped would suck. Much to my surprise and pleasure the seats were fine! Of course I have noticed that most of the negative reviews were for Airbus planes and we flew on a 767 but the seats were identical to the regular AC flight we took on our second leg. There was plenty of leg room. In fact there was more leg room on the Rouge flight than on the Lufthansa flight we took getting there. The seats were plenty wide. The staff were a little young but nice and cheerful. The food was great and plenty of it. I read so many bad things about the lack of inflight entertainment but then they played two recently released movies on the cabin televisions more than I got on my last American Airlines flight going the same route. Overall it was a great flight and experience. In fact it was much better than the second leg we flew on regular AC in that the staff sucked on the AC flight and they charged for snacks and food.

313,LAX to MEL on new 787-9 Dreamliner. This is the world's longest 787 route at around 15 hours so I would not even had considered flying United if they were using their old 747 with no IFE. This flight was excellent to the point I was wondering if I was actually flying United. I was in economy plus (which is not premium economy) but the extra legroom for a small surcharge really makes a big difference for such a long flight.

This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380). The only negative would be that you have to depart from the hideous terminal 7 at LAX.

As always when Qantas service is good it is unbeatable. Excellent service for the full business cabin from the mature crew especially the CSM.

I had downloaded plenty of programmes to watch on my iPad anyway and I'm pleased I did. The flight attendants were polite and helpful. There was a bit of a language barrier but their English was good enough to get by without much difficulty.

332,Having flown 45 weeks or so annually and now scaling back I fly Southwest for both business and pleasure. Southwest is an easy transition. With all the cutbacks and cattle calls that airlines have migrated to SW at least makes it simple ABC. If you can't figure that out sit in the middle. Their gate attendants are knowledgeable take the same stupid questions over and over yet answer them in a polite manner.,1,"After about 45 weeks of the year and now that I fly back, I fly to the South West for business and pleasure.

333,Having chosen this airline based on reviews here and the competitive price of a return ticket from London to Melbourne I was not disappointed. Service by flight attendants was top-notch even in the dead of night. The Boeing 777s might not be the latest but they are still up to the task; the seats were comfortable and the IFE was perfectly adequate. As previous reviews have pointed out Brunei airport can't presently be compared with Singapore or even Kuala Lumpur but as the cabin crew pointed out on landing there on both the outbound and return legs the airport is undergoing substantial renovation so there's hope for a better layover experience. My only slight gripe was that only one meal was served on the outbound leg from Brunei to Melbourne - lunch - with no snacks or other food served before landing which seemed a bit stingy given the length of the flight. That said the food served was generally excellent - tasty and better than other airline food I've eaten in the past! Boarding at Brunei on the return leg from there to Dubai was a little chaotic but this might have been the fault of the airport rather than the airline. The 2 stop itinerary - Dubai and Brunei - actually suited me quite well as I hate being cooped up in a plane for hours on end. Given the great level of customer service on board and the competitive pricing this airline has a lot to recommend it.,1,"After choosing this airline based on the reviews here and the competitive price of a return ticket from London to Melbourne, I was not disappointed.

It was like a scene out of a movie, my husband and I and our three small children running through the terminals to arrive right as the door was shut. We were crushed. The staff member that was at the terminal tried to find us another flight to Orlando, but nothing was flying out until the next morning. We were tired, hungry, and heartbroken as we tried explaining to our kids that it probably wasn't going to happen today. Everyone was very apologetic.

340,MEL-HKG-YYZ return in economy. It was okay let's face it economy is never going to be fantastic but for economy it was just fine and I would do it again. As we were going to Canada we were allowed 23kg x 2 which is great. I considered upgrading to Premium Economy but it would have been an EXTRA $4000 for the two of us just too much. The flight to and from HKG from Mel was fine. Seat a little hard but we found sitting on their blanket in its bag helped there. The food was okay. The FA's were lovely very friendly. Entertainment very good also. Flight to Toronto was full. We paid extra for exit row seats. Was very cold against the door. I had wrapped just about everything I could around my legs it was really freezing there but still not a bad seat in that you could just walk straight out of it no climbing over anyone so if you go for that seat bring warm items for your legs. Going to YYZ was better than returning. Returning the staff seemed to disappear. They were not very organised at YYZ coming back either the line ups were all messed up and wheelchairs couldn't get through. They called the far rows first before business and it was just a big crazy mess of confused people. We were late leaving HKG for MEL due to late passengers but not surprising as there was a gate change. Mostly though the flights were on time our luggage arrived safely the entertainment was good and thank goodness there were no shell seats as what we experienced back in March. After travelling to Canada before via LA this is a far better option even if longer. Stopping over in HKG is ideal and the airport there is very efficient.,1,"MEL-HKG-YYYZ Return to the economy.

353,Bucharest - Barcelona - Aalborg. Both my flights were absolutely event-free and quite pleasant!

The only reason I'm not rating it as great is because they did nothing outstanding. The only inconvenience was the checked-in luggage policy: regardless of how many bags you bring the weight limit is for the sum of all your bags and it's only 23 kg.

359,Booked MAN-DOH-HKG return. DOH-HKG operated by CX so this review refers only to the MAN-DOH sectors. Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room) return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia.

361,Seattle-Dubai-Delhi and return. My first time with Emirates. Flew economy. 777-300 on all the legs. Positives: decent meals plenty of choices in IFE baggage offloading was quick. Negatives: for some reason during SEA-DXB leg the formation of two lavatories each per section didn't seem to work very well. There always seemed to be a line up. All four times they seem to be always taking off a bit late from all the four points of departure. We were bussed to the terminal at DUB on arrival from DEL which took extra 30 minutes of our lay over. Cabin crew could use a bit more politeness. Too many announcements and most of them were barely audible and sounded like mumblings. Overall not bad but I was expecting a bit more.,1,"Seattle-Dubai-Delhi and back. My first time with Emirates.

363,I've just endured a night of going nowhere except a 2 hour flight over the English countryside. The Dubai flight was due to depart at 2155 and we boarded on time. We then sat on the plane for 3 hours while a fault was fixed. I should say at this point that the crew were excellent and served us all whatever we wanted from the bar and did their best to provide information. When we finally took off the pilot soon broke the news that the fault had re-occured during take off and we had to return to Luton after burning off some fuel hence the flight going no-where. When back on the ground at 0400 the ground crew really tried their best to provide options but when you have such a tiny fleet these options didnt include transfering to another plane sadly. And that sums up Silverjet I think. When it works it really is fantastic. When there are problems although the staff are first class they simply do not have the infrastructure to properly deal with it.,1,"I've just gone through a night where I've got nowhere to go but a two-hour flight across the English countryside.

367,Flew Singapore from Brisbane to Paris via Singapore and then return on the same path. Check in staff and flight attendants on all trips were very professional and helpful. Air con hardly worked between Brisbane and Singapore and was most uncomfortable. Also very disappointed (and annoyed) when offered peanuts as a snack despite telling the airline that I was anaphylactic to peanuts!

368,I flew yesterday on Air Canada Rouge and expected only the worst from the angry reviews I've read. I've heard there was little to no leg room a terrible in-flight entertainment system and even worse customer service/delays. But none of these appeared to be true on my flight. First of all you can pay a little more for extra leg room and by doing so you get more room than you would on the main line. People may complain paying extra is ridiculous but if they're that concerned about not having enough room it's probably worth it. For the in-flight entertainment it was pretty weak. There are no longer TVs on the back of every seat like there are on the main airline. You can access it on your laptop tablets and phones but the content is limited and outdated. What I did and what I recommend doing is renting movies on your laptop or tablet or whatever prior to the flight so you can watch those without hassle. In regards to the delays I flew on Air Canada Rouge both ways and I didn't experience any delays either way. In fact I found they were quicker than the main airline. The one thing I do mind about the new charter airline is the in-flight entertainment. Oh well I guess it's the way of the future.,1,"I flew with Air Canada Rouge yesterday and expected only the worst of the angry reviews I read.

However the transfer at Narita was terrible. Only two out of the three security stations were staffed. Stood in line waiting to go through the transfer security check for over 45 minutes.

376,Flew with family SJC-Honolulu then returned to SJC via Seattle. Economy Class. All planes were 737's of some variety. The seats were comfortable with adjustable headrests but legroom was terrible. I'm short so this was only a problem when I (or someone else) wanted to use the restroom as the person on the aisle seat had no choice but to get out of his seat to accommodate us. The cheese platter is an excellent meal available on all flights.

However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can.

380,LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase!

I also took advantage of the complimentary treatment in the spa with a scalp message. The call to board came all too soon as I could quite easily have stayed in the lounge a while longer. Turning left on the plane and walking through premium you are met with ambient mood lighting and a glass of champagne.

The call came much too early, as I could have stayed in the lounge for a while. If you turn left on the plane and walk through the premium area, you will be greeted with ambient mood lighting and a glass of champagne. What is striking from the moment you board is the exceptional service that is proactive. I can't remember ever asking for anything during the 10 hour 45 minute flight because the staff were so dedicated. 11 / 10"
388,Brussels to Geneva A319 economy class not much legroom but the empty seat beside me was a bonus. You have to pay for food / drinks but that is the case with many other non low-cost airlines too in economy class (such as Iberia / Aer Lingus etc). Staff were pleasant enough flight landed on time.

389,"The booking of our flights was straightforward. However, when we have paid to sit next to each other, and paid for the opportunity to book seats in advance, you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilets and galleys are so that as the paying customer we would have a choice as to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight, on this occasion British Airways failed miserably.

It was old dirty and basically a disgrace. The crew were in their old United way ""Perfunctory"". They had a job to do. Do it and get the passengers out of their hair.

401,Originally a KLM flight however the flight was overbooked and I was re-routed through Paris with Air France (2 days prior to actual flight). Flying Bangkok-CDG-Prague and return. It was and is quite annoying that Air France offers online check in however has all seats (apart from some mid aisle) blocked and you are unable to choose or plan all AF is trying to push is seats with more legroom but many fail to realise that these are just by the lavatories and kitchens thus very uncomfortable (lights crowded and many just stand there to stretch).

Return flight uneventful (with much older plane with visibly less comfort and legroom and ancient useless entertainment) and surprised that the transit in CDG was all right except having 20+ passport control booths and only 1 serviced!

So a good experience and a recommendation."
420,"The quality of the airline has deteriorated badly. My first connection BOM-DEL was delayed with prior intimation which was fine. I reached DEL at the eleventh hour when the boarding for PAR had already begun. I met the worst ground staff at DEL airport who don't even know how to behave with a passenger and behave as if doing a big favour. I was not attended by any transit desk people and when contacted the AI staff asked me to run behind people on transit to other destinations that was just so cheap. Next thing was the annoying security check which took nearly 30 minutes with a quick immigration for transit passengers. The flight was quite empty and quite comfortable, with friendly cabin crew. But the flight was mostly full of foreigners and the announcement was missing in French and the really fast Indian English was really sad for the French people who kept asking me to translate what they meant. Arrival in Paris was very smooth. I wouldn't mind flying with AI but I would never ever fly via DEL airport again in my life except for my return flight and I would not mind shelling out some extra chunks for this matter. The ticket was the cheapest even at the last minute.",1,"The quality of the airline has deteriorated significantly. My first connection BOM-DEL was delayed with previous hint, which was fine.

The flight arrived on time and the cabin crew were very polite. The service was excellent with on demand entertainment comfortable reclining seats to sleep in and a complimentary meal service.

424,Recently flew from LAX to San Salvador and then on to Lima Peru. I thought the flight down was much better than the flight coming back. Got a special rate which was nice. Staff were excellent on my first flight and very helpful. Food was good as I am a vegetarian so requested special meal which was pasta salad and a roll. Seats were very comfortable.

Was told that a change to the earlier flight would cost me a change fee and I did not want to do that so waited the 5 hours in San Salvador for the later flight.

452,LHR-Cork in Nov. Checked in online very easily. Flight was quick to board cabin crew were friendly and the seats were comfy.

453,One of the main problems of this airline is the inconsistency of its product. The fleet has been modernized in the last two or three years but they still dispose of many ancient B737s and Avros. Seat pitch is better than with many competitors but broken seats can be found much too often. FA's sometimes are overwhelmingly friendly but as a rule they are uninterested and rude. My last flight BRU-TXL-BRU was quite typical: Outbound flight on a relatively new A319 extremely unfriendly chief purser other FA's indifferent. Inbound on an old Avro but FAs very friendly. Unusually cordial welcome (and farewell) by the Captain and we arrived half an hour early. All bets are off with this airline - expect the best and the worst.,1,"One of the main problems with this airline is the inconsistency of its product.

454,Flew LHR-BEG-LHR. Significant improvement from JAT in terms of on board experience especially aesthetic. A319 interior appearance in terms of seat colour lighting and cleanliness on par if not better than the likes of Lufthansa BA Air France. Plane took off on-time on both legs crew were very kind and helpful and seat comfort was solid. The fact that a full meal was served on a 2.5 hour flight was certainly a plus tasted better than what was served on my BA transatlantic flight home. My only reproach would be the slightly irritating boarding music a tad bit too traditional for a 21st century airline setting. All in all it's clear that the company is on the right track and I would not be surprised if it soon ranks among Europe's best in terms of service quality. Glad to see the on-time performance improving day by day especially considering the earlier issues with the Beirut flights.,1,"Fly LHR-BEG-LHR.

455,LHR to LAX and back a week later in Premium Economy. It was really excellent on all fronts: friendly and efficient service from check-in to arrival. The food was plentiful and very nice quality: a salad starter with fresh bread and NZ olive oil a warm meal; dessert cheese and biscuits and good NZ wines. Breakfast and afternoon tea were also excellent with e.g. warm scones clotted cream and jam. The food was better than BA's Club World. The seat provides lots of space and the entertainment system is stocked with films I missed at the cinema so enjoyed catching up with on the plane. The seat doesn't recline that much but there's a bean bag a big pillow and a nice thoughtful amenity kit. There were other fun touches too like a photo of shelves of books with jokey titles on the walls in the toilet. On the way out the luggage belts at Heathrow were broken so most bags did not make it to the plane. Air NZ handled this efficiently on the plane and with minimal fuss in LA we were handed US$100 in cash.

461,CZ327 from Guangzhou to Los Angels economy class in last month. It was a satisfactory trip. The A380 is a pretty good plane with comfortable seats. One thing that impressed me was that when I got hungry during the flight I told one staff member that I wanted to buy some food. Even though she told me that there was no additional food for sale she gave me some cookies for free. Many latest Chinese movies can be found on the plane which made my long trip less boring.

These people are trying to avoid the cost of putting luggage in the hold but why should the rest of us sit cramped up with no leg room on their account.

Onboard the A330 was new and clean seats comfortable staff were very attentive and friendly. Food was outstanding the best first class food I ever had. The greatest drawback was the IFE.

A good choice of beverages available and I consumed around 3 glasses of champagne and port during my main meal. Had the steak which were okay for an airline meal. The club kitchen was pretty well stocked with sandwiches fruit chocolate cakes and champagne in plenty of supply. A light meal was offered around 90 minutes before landing I had the afternoon tea (sandwiches) my wife a salad. Some excellent warm scones were provided. I was happy with my choice but my wife thought the salad too light for a secondary meal. Overall the food was okay but I have had better on Singapore Airlines ANZ and even AA. The IFE system was dated with the screen being not as sharp as other airlines and the choice of movies limited compared to other airlines. On the return journey I slept most of the flight after the meal. My wife reported the club kitchen was well stocked contrary to some reports it is often empty on flights returning to Heathrow.

Fast track and lounge a pity. EK uses SN lounge and it is outdated and crowed always. Whatever time of day. Used not only by Star alliance members but also other partners too which makes it too warm overcrowded and nowhere to seat. Boarding ok and then the usual fab experience of EK first class although on B777 suites are smaller and not the luxury of showers. No amenity kit either. Connecting in Dubai is a mess.

To have the bag repaired took me forever and wasted a whole day waiting for a pick up service who after an 8 hour wait never turned up. Very disappointed. Customer service is not good either.

472,Travelled from Manchester UK to Newark then onwards to Las Vegas. Was very apprehensive after reading some dreadful reviews of UA. Became more apprehensive when attempting online check in 24hrs before the flight - our two seats were not together which for a long flight was a concern. After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time. Internal flight between Newark & Las Vegas fairly standard neither good nor bad. Found direct comparison between Economy Plus & Economy legroom! No free food offered on the 5hr internal flight although available to purchase. Overall was very pleased with the flights however unsure I'd want a repeat of the apprehension again wondering if we had seats never mind sitting together!

473,My wife and I have just returned from Turkey flying with Freebird. I had read previous reviews and was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised.

476,ORD-HKG Oct 10. First Class on Cathay commands a premium but in the end you get little more than a bigger seat. Consistency and orientation seem to be big problems. For example they seem to offer some F passengers an escort through security while others (like me) do not get one. They offered a padded mattress (duvet) to some passengers but not to me. For the most part I was ignored. The Inflight Service Manager introduced herself at the beginning of the flight then disappeared for the remainder of the flight. The cabin crew delivers the meal then hides in the galley. They ran out of Heineken beer about 2 hours into a 16 hour flight. Don't get me wrong… the flight is not awful. The seat really is big. They serve 1 can of caviar Krug champagne Johnny Walker Blue and so on but how much of that do you really consume?

481,I fly Spirit Airlines often have been using this airlines for years. Yes they do charge for nearly everything. However flying from LGA to MYR Spirit is the way to go. Just be prepared check in at LGA is a real pain. Make sure you get there early once checked in everything always seems to go smoothly. Check in at MYR is much easier and more efficient. Book way in advance and choose the seat you would like my wife and I always spend the bucks for the wide seats so much better than other seats. Check out other airlines you will find Spirit to be the best going between the two airports listed above.,1,"I fly with Spirit Airlines and have been using it for years.

The first 3 flights were on comfortable planes while the final leg from Beijing to HKG was on an old leased Air Macau plane which was rather cramped. Food isn't great but flights were on time and the air hostesses excellent. Movie selection is spartan but I took an ipod so didn't mind.

487,LHR-FRA-HEL both on A321s. First flight left a little late. Food was a small sandwich or a museli yoghurt I had the latter which was ok for the length of flight. Plenty of drink options and an efficient crew. Quick transit in FRA then they decided to change the gate twice. I did receive SMS messages about this and the gate staff were apologetic. The flight to HEL left late as the aircraft was late in from Hamburg. Again good crew. 2 choices of small sandwiches neither I could eat due to some of the ingredients. The stewardess said she would try and find me an alternative and sure enough came back with a chocolate and nut croissant. Unusual for the time of day it was not bad at all and you cannot fault her attempt to find me something I could eat. Going that little bit further shows why LH is one of my favourite airlines.

489,My sister and I flew to and from JFK to Paris (CDG) this past weekend and had an excellent experience. All the processes from checking-in to customer service to inflight to claiming our luggage to doing it all over again on our way back were flawless. I was impressed at the level of professionalism the airline's personnel exhibit. Our flight was on time out of JFK and 10 minutes late out CDG. Both ways we arrived on time. Our luggage was not lost but instead it was delivered promptly and with all the contents. The seats are just like any other airline. They're small yes. They are comfortable enough I chose to sit in the middle and do not regret it. The food is airplane food. Any real traveler knows what that means. It doesn't come from a 5-star restaurant nor is it cooked by a Michelin star awarded chef. But it's not bad either. The inflight entertainment was good too.

There was a 3.5 hour delay due to a faulty AV system on a rather old Airbus aircraft and the passengers had to endure a fair amount of discomfort as a result of this. The return flight from Doha to Cape Town on the Dreamliner was also delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and an electrical problem on the aircraft.

504,AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable.

517,Recently travelled from Brisbane to Launceston and over the past 4 months I have made many return trips due to my moving. The flight times are very convenient and all but one flight was on time with departure and sometimes early on arrival. One flight was 25 minutes late due to weather which is of no consequence. All aircraft's were clean and cabin crew were fine. Several times I had emergency exit seats offered which I accepted and have no complaint with my treatment. I don't usually purchase food as I am sure I can survive for 2.5 hrs. The fares were all cheap easy to book and are good value. As always you get what you pay for. I rarely take luggage so the fare structure suits me and I always pay via Direct Debit to save on Credit Card Fees.

FA's extremely courteous and attentive for both legs excellent IFE and seemingly very well executed landings. Only gripe is the rather inefficient process of attaining boarding passes due to the code share with Air Berlin. At first Air Berlin staff informed me something was strange about my booking and they could only check me in as far as Dusseldorf after making me wait 15 minutes they then told me they could check me in as far as Abu Dhabi. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi had to line up again to get my boarding pass for onward flight to Hyderabad. Surely it should be possible to check passengers and their luggage through to the final destination from the point of first departure. I didn't understand the logic in that.

542,It's decadent luxury to fly the SQ A380 Suites from Singapore to New York. Of course I'm tempted to compare them to the Emirates suites and I have to say that overall this is a much more luxurious spacious and comfortable product than Emirates. Minus the shower which I do miss on such a long journey. The suite is on the lower deck which is wider and the sides don't curve in as they do on the upper deck so the suite is very spacious. The leather seat is extremely comfortable and plush and when they convert the suite into a bed which is separate from the seat it's the best bed in the air that I've slept in. All this can be done because the SQ suite is modular where parts move up and down as they convert it from sitting room to bed room. The food and service was excellent as is customary on SQ. I sat in row 3 which is the only row with 3 windows. I like to look out and have as much light as I can so this is important to me. Although I still don't like the A380 windows for they are recessed and make you feel like you're in a submarine!,1,"It is decadent luxury to fly from Singapore to New York with the SQ A380 Suites.

543,Booked over a month in advance for my wife and I. Then try to check in online the night before and they have us in different rows both flights. When I called the agent said maybe because we have different names. Really? So even if you book at the same time they assume you are not together?

On board the crew were very friendly and BMI is fast becoming my favourite airline. I asked what the movies were and was referred to the guide. The channels did not match what was in the magazine when I showed the crew they realised they had loaded the wrong media so they loaded the film I wanted to see on an unused channel. Great service recovery. I'm not sure why wash bags were not offered to the passengers as they were on my BMI flight to TBS a week or two earlier perhaps they have run out during the run up to the take over by BA. Luggage in BEY was waiting on the carousel. Return flight BEY check in staff were friendly and directed me to the lounge. The look was dull space small and catering non existent.

555,San Francisco to Taipei. After a couple hours spent in the EVA lounge in SFO my expectations were rather low. The lounge was small located down a long narrow corridor and offered a very modest selection of food. Once on board the flight though everything changed. The flight attendants guided the guests to their seats and were very attentive throughout the flight. I didn't want to eat the entire evening meal (the flight only leaves after midnight) and that was no problem. The food was excellent with a good selection of wines. In-flight entertainment was certainly adequate. The somewhat angled seats had lots of storage areas and once the seat was brought to the flat position I could stretch my long body out fully.

556,Beirut to London. Quick and efficient check-in with friendly staff. The meals in Business are well prepared and plenty. The Cabin crew are friendly. The best thing is that you do not have cabin attendants treating passengers like children with their over obsessive and disturbing multiple checks on seat belts and hand luggage.

559,NUE-DUS-CUR Return. Dash 8/A330-200. Air Berlin has a good product in Economy Class. Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights. Two meals are provided;1 warm meal two hours into the flight and the second cold (and small) approximately 60 min before landing. This was the same for in/outbound. This means no refreshments or snacks for approximately 6-8hours!! So BYO! In addition make sure you select a low row number 1-35 rows in the back of the aircraft cannot select meals and get whatever is left. Meals are rather poor in quantity and quality.

560,Flew from KL to Frankfurt via Hanoi. It seemed like a strange detour but was the cheapest option. We were served decent meals (even on the shorter flight which was surprising) and wide selection of drinks inc. small cocktail menu sparkling wine red or white wine/beer.

Seats in economy were wider than usual and comfortable we were going to pay for an upgrade to deluxe economy (4-5 inches more room) but once we saw the seats we didn't bother. Entertainment on long haul was small in seat screens with a good selection but all the films started at the same time so if you missed the start you had to wait for it to finish and start again. Cabin crew were really attentive and really friendly. Would certainly fly with them again. The online check-in is extremely dated and one of the oldest websites I have ever seen.

563,Our flight Prague to Madrid (A319) was badly delayed supposedly due to a last-minute crew replacement. The staff started issuing new boarding passes at the gate effectively scrapping the passengers' seating preferences but they were unable to provide any information on the delay. After about 70 minutes at the gate the airline let everyone on board just to keep them waiting for another 2 hours. This seems to be CSA's favorite way of avoiding passenger rights claims as it automatically falls within 'tarmac delay' - people on board only got a glass of water while waiting. The crew never said anything about the actual cause of the delay and didn't seem to care much about it. The inflight snack consisted of the usual ham and cheese sandwich a cold and a hot drink. The arrival to MAD was further delayed by about 30 minutes while waiting in the landing stack meaning that we missed our connection even though we'd originally had 4 hours for transfer within the same terminal. The flight back (MAD-PRG) two weeks later was substantially better: a newer A319 on time and with a friendly crew (although their language skills remain disappointing). The seats in more recent narrowbody aircraft are decent with adjustable headrests and sufficient legroom. Inflight snacks keep to the same standard (small chicken sandwich drinks) the entertainment system only has a few LCD screens throughout the plane showing the flight details occasional video clips and a very very dated presentation of Prague. All in all the experience was more pleasant than the previous trip and the ground staff has been very helpful in locating and retrieving my lost baggage upon arrival.,1,"Our flight Prague to Madrid (A319) was reportedly delayed considerably due to a last minute change of crew.

566,MAD-MIA on a new A330. IB has a very frustrating problem with pre-reserved seats. I like an aisle to the point where I am willing to pay extra for it. However I discovered that simply wasn't possible in this case. I was booked on the AA codeshare flight (IB6123) and was unable to display my reservation on the IB website until the day before departure. 24 hours prior to departure I did online check in when my booking mysteriously appeared. The system printed out a PDF file with no seat allocation and told me to check at the airport so I called IB. They too were unable to display my reservation and told me that as I had gone into online check in they would be unable to change my seat allocation anyway. The fact that I did not have a seat allocation appeared not to matter. I later went back to the website and tried recheck in and this time the system printed out a proper boarding pass and yes an aisle seat. At no point in the process did I get a choice. This is a great shame because I found check in staff gate staff and the flight crew all very professional and friendly. The A330 is an excellent product and the meal and drinks service was perfectly adequate and followed by an afternoon snack box prior to arrival in Miami. The entertainment system is very good with a good selection of movies on demand. I did find that some of the movies offered were not loaded in the system and were therefore unavailable. We left 15 minutes late and arrived on-time so this was a good flight. If IB resolved the seat allocation issue it would be a greatly improved airline.,1,"MAD-MIA on a new A330.

571,Leeds Bradford to Palma 1/8/14 FR2326. Palma to Leeds Bradford 8/8/14 FR2327. Having not flown for 14 years because of a fear of flying I decided to take the plunge and book. Past reviews about Ryanair made me nervous and my computer skills are a little rusty. However having read the instructions my husband and I printed off our boarding passes etc without problem. I found Ryanair staff to be very courteous and understanding of my anxiety issues.

572,My 13 year old granddaughter flew unaccompanied aboard an Icelandair flight from Reykjavik to Sanford FL recently and then on a return flight 12 days later. While going through security at the Keflavik terminal one of the Security Agents stopped her and wanted verification that she was allowed to travel alone. Upon her arrival in Sanford FL she was stopped again while the customs officer verified who was meeting her. He then came out to meet my wife and me before allowing my granddaughter to proceed. When checking in for her return flight the airline agent at the Icelandair counter remembered her name and also asked for verification of her status and our relationship. I could not be more impressed and genuinely appreciate the special efforts of all the agents involved.

I spent the duration of the entire flight from Heathrow to Newark (connecting flight) catching up with my readings.

577,My wife and I took a return flight from Amsterdam to Dubai. Departure at Amsterdam delayed 5 hours due to weather in Amsterdam so we missed our connecting flight to Dubai. PGS call centre offered us the choice of refunding our money or taking the next flight 2 days later. Both options not acceptable for we were booked on a cruise ship leaving the next day. Decided to take the delayed flight to Istanbul and booked (and paid for) a flight with Emirates from Istanbul to Dubai the next day. Not very convenient. However the way Pegasus dealt with their delayed passengers was a pleasant surprise. Upon arrival PGS staff were available got us through customs and assisted in claiming our luggage and within half an hour we were in a nice hotel at PGS cost. For a low-cost carrier like PGS this exceeded my expectations. Flights were convenient given the price. Free baggage allowance of 20 kg is not common these days. Positive surprise was the apt of Sabinha Gokcen nice and modern and easy to find you way. Return flights were spot on time.

579,Outbound flight from LHR to BAH was excellent good service and good food/drink. The second stage from BAH to BKK was far from good with unresponsive staff and poor quality food. The return journey from BKK to BAH was once again let down by the staff attitude toward the customer however once again the second part of the flight from BAH to LHR was much better with the exception of the headrest TVs which seemed to work when they felt like.

593,LHR to SYD via Dubai on an A380. Overall the Qantas product is average at best which is a shame given the excellent product that once it was. Boarded aircraft at LHR and offered a drink however once finished glasses collected and despite a 2 hour delay nothing further was offered. Not sure what the current procedures are on Qantas however once the plane had finally taken off it was another 2 hours before a meal or drinks service was offered bringing the aggregated time of almost 4 hours without any service. This is simply not acceptable when compared with the competition. Once the service had commenced the food and drink offering was significantly more Spartan than previous trips on the carrier. The stopover in Dubai was OK - the emirates business lounge was enormous however the one thing that was not sufficient were the shower facilities with a 30 mins wait despite the overall lounge being almost the size of a football field! Once on route to Sydney service again was slow following take off demonstrating that the London leg was not a one off. The IFE package was however excellent and the seats on board very comfortable. Something that does seem a waste of time is the so called on board business lounge and self service bar. Tiny area with the offering at bar comprising of a half drunk bottle of red wine 3 cans of coke and 3 packets of crisps. If this is the offering suggest that Qantas consider removing this facility and replace it with additional toilets as every time I went to use these facilities there was a 10-15 wait which is something one hopes to avoid in business class. On arrival in Sydney everything worked like clockwork and returned to the levels of service that I had previously associated with Qantas. Suggest that this airline needs to spend more time focussing on the overall service provided rather than gimmicks such a new uniforms.,1,"LHR to SYD via Dubai with an A380.

601,Geneva-Doha Doha KL on 29th/30th Jan 2014. Embarkation at Geneva was smooth and efficient. The flight attendants were most attentive and the food excellent. Arriving at Doha and going to the Premium Transfer complex is a breeze. Food seating capacity showers it is all there and certainly a notch over most other airlines' premium facilities I would say. Had a few hours to spend in the Premium facility and time passed quickly. The flight from Doha to KL was excellent also: flight attendants present and anticipating your needs. The food very good indeed. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when trying to sleep. I thoroughly dislike them as there is not much space to put things away and one is not lying flat (I need a flat surface for medical reasons).

The flight attendants were very attentive and the food excellent. Arriving in Doha and visiting the Premium Transfer Complex is a breeze. The capacity for dining is there and certainly a peculiarity compared to the premium facilities of most other airlines, I would say. Had to spend a few hours in the premium facility and time passed quickly. The flight from Doha to KL was also excellent: flight attendants were present and anticipated your needs. The food very good. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when I fall asleep. I don't like it because there's not much space to put things away and you don't lie flat (for medical reasons I need a flat surface). I do not understand why the seats on the Airbus are slanted, but not on the 777? I hope to be able to fly with Qatar again, but with their Boeing 777 and not their Airbus."

603,Madrid to Bogota at the end of April in the old business class seats and had a very good flight expect for the food. Spanish cuisine is of the most delicious and interesting in the world and Iberia hired several Michelin-starred chefs to deal with their catering but this airline serve some awful stuff onboard. My started Salmorejo was very good even though it was served from a Tetra Pak container. Yet my main course tasted as though it was bought from KFC and then they poured some sort of gravy over it. It was dreadful. I did not mind the old business plus seats as the cabin was almost empty but I expected a good meal. I do not drink so cannot comment on their wines. Shame on IOberia you are not a good ambassador to Spain's wonderful cuisine. As for the second meal again dreadful: the usual dry and fatty ham bread. tomato sauce cheese etc. I have been using Iberia to travel to Latin America for many years and this second meal is the same. Time to change. Those expensive chefs are useless. Listen to your passengers not to them. I have a flight with them at the end of the month and will take my own food. The good thing apart from the seats is that the flight attendants are very charming they engage with passengers and are not grumpy as they used to be. The connecting in Madrid from London was easy and Iberia's lounge is excellent with a very good selection of food and drinks.,1,"Madrid to Bogota in late April in the old business class seats and had expected a very good flight for the food.

606,Singapore-Athens via Doha return. Mix of aircraft 777-300er and A330-200 outbound returning on A320 and 787. Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand.

610,Flew from Dhaka to London in October with new Boeing 777 on business class. To be honest wasn't that bad but they do need to look after their Business class passengers a bit more. Plane was new and entertainment was alright most movies are outdated by least by 6+ months. Foods were okay just to fill you up I found Qatar Economy food even better then Biman Business class.

I have only one complaint and that is that the departure hall in KEF crams several gates into a small area with almost no seats. Saga class is quite comfortable and the level of service was excellent. The cabin crew was friendly and attentive without being intrusive. The seats are not lie-flat and don't even recline very far but they are spacious and comfortable. The food from JFK-KEF was quite good from KEF-JFK I had the sushi which was ok. In-flight entertainment was decent although there were quite a few commercials for various Iceland tours.

I had 5 flights covering a 3 week period and flew from Glasgow - Newark- Las Vegas - San Fran - San Diego back to Newark - Glasgow and was totally happy with the service provided to my family and I. We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them. Will definitely be recommending UA to anyone who asks.,1,"I must say that after reading the reviews on this page, I was extremely hesitant to fly with UA on August 22, 2014.

634,Flew today from Dubai to Amsterdam. After reading these reviews I am wondering which airline workers they had on their plane. Everyone was so thoughtful and nice on the flight. Take off and landing was smooth sailing. Food today were great. About an hour or two in I was offered eggs with bread yoghurt butter jam potatoes or pancakes. Drinks were constantly being provided. Lunch was provided. Simple hot cheese sandwiches or spicy chicken were options. Again drinks were provided. Hot towels and headphones were also given.,1,"Fly from Dubai to Amsterdam today.

635,LGW-VRN (Gatwick-Verona). My first trip with Easyjet and I will admit to a sense of trepidation using a budget airline with a bit of a reputation! Carry-on only so I did not have the apparent burden of queuing to check a bag. I also used the speedy-board option which avoided the one gripe I would have: people boarded the plane from both front and rear but without any consideration to seat allocation meaning that people were trying to pass each other in the aisle with bags in hand - close to mayhem. Seats were comfortable and legroom good (I'm a reasonably tall person) flight attendants very friendly and helpful. In summary I was pleasantly surprised.,1,"LGW-VRN (Gatwick-Verona). My first trip with Easyjet and I admit I was a little shaken when using a budget airline with a certain reputation! Just so I didn't have the apparent burden of queuing to check a bag.

636,LHR-MAD-LHR. Fast check-in at both airports with friendly staff. The A321s were clean comfortable and in good condition. Lots of legroom if you sit in the front rows. Cabin crew on the outbound flight nothing special just did their job. On the return flight they were more friendly and attentive. I bought a ham sandwich on one of the flights and it was good although I still consider that the menu is a little bit overpriced. Captains on both flights were chatty and gave many details about the flight always interesting to hear them. I think Iberia is a good option given that sometimes they are not expensive at all and I think you get more service for your money comparing to low cost airlines. I repeat that if they only offered some drinks for free onboard they would be a very good choice.,1,"LHR-MAD-LHR. Quick check-in at both airports with friendly staff.

637,Las Vegas to Honolulu  good on time flight coach seating adequate best seats for legroom are 26AC or 26HJ on Boeing 767 aircraft. First Class seating looked good but not worth paying anything over $250 for upgrades on US Mainland to Hawaii flights would obviously be happy to pay more for longer distance flights.

638,BOG to ADZ (San Andres Isla) on March 31st and back on April 4th: everything went smoothly flights on time operated by nice and new planes with comfortable seats and good service delivered with a smile. Both A320 had the personal TV screen which is not common on a less than 2hr flight and a good entertainment system (suffering some rebooting problems during the return flight). Tickets not very cheap though (USD 900 for two persons) but very close to the only two competitors available for this route (LAN and COPA). The only problem with Avianca national flights is the Puente Aereo terminal they use in Bogota kind of small and overcrowded building while the brand new international terminal (El Dorado) is a state of the art facility.

639,I flew LHR-DEL-LHR and this was my first AI experience. Overall I would say it wasn't bad but it could easily be so much more better. Check-ins both in London and Delhi were smooth and easy. On Board service and facilities lets it down. The staff even though well meaning are not interested. They simply did their three rounds (1 round of drinks and 2 of meals) and no more. On both flights the service call bell was not attended to even though I must have pressed it for at least 10 mins before giving up and getting up! On the LHR-DEL flight I did not complain about it but when I enquired on the DEL-LHR flight about why they did not attend to the service call they could not find it on the system.

For the SIN-BKK sector I had the prawn in chilli paste with rice option. The prawns were absolutely delicious. The meal also came with a tasty omelette fried with basil leaves and a pasta salad with ham. On return from BKK I had the chicken curry option which was another winner!

I went to the airport ready to do battle but much to my surprise I was quickly processed through there were no surprise extra costs and the flights were in fact uneventful. I again flew last week to and from San Diego and the experience was the same. Yes I wish they had better seats with more leg room and perhaps provide some sustenance during the flight but I guess one has to prepare for lack of such amenities when flying budget. Would I fly with them again? Yes I would. During the four flights I had with Spirit I saw the ground/airport crew work overtime to make sure that we did not miss the connecting flights when there were delays sometimes personally escorting/directing the passengers through the maze of airport hubs and the on-air crews were always pleasant.,1,"I first flew Spirit in November 2013 on a return trip to and from Cancun Mexico.

654,Had been reading Norwegian reviews here since I booked tickets for the new LGW-JFK service. Both flights left departed and arrived on-time (give or take 10 minutes). The 787 was clean felt new and was comfortable. Legroom was no worse than any other transatlantic economy service (and was certainly not the worst I've encountered). The night flight could be aided by offering quieter announcements the flight leaves at 11pm I'm pretty sure if you haven't eaten or ordered meal service you're ready for sleep. Very loud announcements about duty free shopping at was effectively 3am were unnecessary.

New aircraft very friendly crew (in contrast with overall rude airport staff in Turkey) great prices and adding baggage/meal and allocated seat with a upgrade it is very good value for a small fee in comparison with other LCC. I recommend Pegasus.,1,"I had a return flight from Istanbul-Kayseri in April and although it was the only experience with Pegasus, I can consider it the best LCC I have ever been allowed to fly.

669,AKL-SIN. Auckland-Singapore on A330. Plane is clean and new. Seats are not the most comfortable though.

670,JFK-NRT return on 777-300ER in Business. Also HND-ITM return in 772 outbound and 763 inbound both in Y. First the trans-pacific legs: ground staff excellent at both JFK and NRT super fast check in polite and welcoming. Sakura Lounge in JFK fine for a business class lounge decent supply of snacks and drinks. Lounge at NRT simply fantastic excellent private showers great drinks selection and good choice of hot dining options upstairs cafeteria style. Onboard hard product for these 773s are simply the best J class in the sky right now. Lay flat bed with airweave mattress pad allows for deep restive complete sleep. Privacy of window seats is unmatched couldn't see anyone else in the cabin or any leaking daylight from opened shades. Food is stellar especially the Japanese options. Loved the dine on demand ordering through the AVOD handset. FAs polite and friendly once you engage them although I noticed they were much more vocal and consistent with Japanese pax. Now for the negatives: service a bit slow during dining was forgotten for about 45 min while others were served then finally when given food salad course was skipped and remaining courses were incomplete (no bread had to ask for utensils etc). Sorry but having to ask for your food on a $6000 revenue ticket is a bit embarrassing for all parties involved. AVOD very limited. Cabin a bit warm but not unbearable. Also outbound IFE audio didn't work power outlet at seat broken JAL Sky WiFi inoperable until I did a little creative clicking around to get the login process to work. Little qualms that were negated by the immense comfort and privacy of the hard product. Overall the best way outside of F cabin to get to Japan.

No entertainment (even music) available on A320. No individual monitor available on B767. Seat and cabin interior definitely need refurbishment.

673,I flew from ANC to TPE with family including one 5 yr old. We had 3 adjacent confirmed seats. The flight originated from JFK. When we checked in at ANC we were put in 3 separated seats because the middle one of our seats had been given to someone boarding at JFK. One of us was given a seat 30 rows further back. I objected and was told that CI staff at JFK can ignore confirmed seats for passengers boarding after JFK and that the plane was full. In other words a confirmed seat didn't really mean that. The seats we were given would have necessitated our 5 yr old sitting separately. I was told that it could probably be sorted out on board. But on boarding the aircraft the aircrew wouldn't even take care of it - I was told that I had to ask the other passenger to switch. I got their attention by saying that we were going to go to our original confirmed seats and they could decide what to do about that at takeoff time. It happened that the JFK originating passenger was willing to switch when he saw the situation but I think it was really bad procedure for CI to have put us through that. Either confirmed seats should mean that or there shouldn't be a pretence that there are confirmed seats. And certainly a young child should never be re-seated to a separated seat.,1,"I flew from the ANC to TPE with my family, including a five-year-old. We had 3 confirmed seats next to each other.

677,I fly PER-MEL-PER on a regular basis. I do not buy luggage pick seats and buy any food on-board. Therefore Tiger has the cheapest flight compared to any other Australian Airlines. I have not encountered any problems yet hopefully not in the future. Seat comfort on the other hand really depends on the pax around you. If the pax kept kicking your seat from behind you will feel uncomfortable. If the pax in front of you reclined their seat you will feel uncomfortable too. Since I know it is a budget airline I do not expect much from it. What I do know is that I have never encountered any problems and flights were always on time (maybe I was just too lucky).,1,"I fly regularly to the airport.

682,My hubby and I have been flying to Thailand each year for the last ten years we decided to shout ourselves an upgrade to business class as it was our ten year anniversary when you check your baggage in you ask how much to upgrade and we got a good deal having always been in economy one thing that really annoyed me was we only like flying during the day and unfortunately on Thai Airways day or night after they serve you food they shut all the shades down and expect you to sleep (this is obviously a ploy to stop asking the crew for drinks etc). However myself and a couple of other people keep our shades open even though the crew always try and shut them to my horror on business class the same thing happened shades went down. If I'm flying business it's my option if I want my shade down or not very annoying..

683,Travelled from London Gatwick to Toronto on 31st December 2013. As I'm moving to St. John's Newfoundland I needed the cheapest way of getting to that outpost with a large luggage allowance and the Air Transat Club Class seemed to provide that for me in terms of getting to Toronto before using another airline onwards. In the main it was excellent. The food on planes is usually of low standard but my Turkey Cacciatore was delicious the light snack meat platter before landing was equally tasty and the other little treats cookies fudge sweets champagne wine port and baileys. Inflight entertainment was fine maybe not as wide ranging as Air Canada but decent nonetheless watched a couple of interesting documentaries in between my constant scoffing. Staff were very friendly the slight downer were the seats not as comfortable some Club Class. But not the price of any Club Class aside so I have no complaints.

685,Outbound flight from Belfast International Airport to Las Palmas was on time and the cabin crew very attentive no complaints. The return flight back from Las Palmas to Belfast International Airport was very disappointing due to a long delay of over 4 hrs. We boarded the flight an hour late and after the safety brief by the cabin crew the jet engines that were revving to go were shut down. A couple of minutes later the Pilot came on tannoy to explain he had to shut them down because there was a technical problem and the parking brake would not release. We were stuck on the plane for 3hrs because according to the Pilot the plane was registered in Canada and the Spanish airplane mechanics refused to fix the problem for this reason. The pilot was not to blame and kept us informed of progress although passengers were becoming restless and angry by the delay. Fortunately the problem which in all intents and purposes was probably minor was fixed after 3 hrs and the plane eventually took off.

699,Flew from Istanbul to Heathrow via Vienna the legroom I thought was not too bad the flights went as planned and on time and staff were friendly enough. In Istanbul I thought the check-in desks could have opened earlier than they did less than 2 hours before departure. I would certainly fly Austrian again as the planes were relatively new clean and comfortable. The only thing that I could not do as I have done with other airlines I have flown is try and pick my seat when booking the flight it may just be because the flight came up on the Lufthansa booking site but never mind all in all I was pretty happy with it all.,1,"Fly from Istanbul via Vienna to Heathrow, I found the legroom not so bad, the flights were on schedule and on time and the staff were friendly enough.

708,Just returned from a trip to Amsterdam via Iceland. No complaints about the on-board service. Pillows and blankets waiting on every seat on the long leg (from Denver to Iceland). Bottled water to pick up on entry into plane and usual drinks served during flight. Luckily I read a review that mentioned you have to purchase food in economy seating so I brought my own. They should mention that more prominently when you book your flight. Also did not know about option to stay over in Iceland for a few days supposedly at no extra ticket cost but I didn't see this offer when I was booking. My only complaint was how little leg room there is on the Boeing 757-200 which is the long leg of the flight. The shorter leg (Iceland to Amsterdam) had the normal amount of leg room; it was a Boeing 757-300. You could always ask for more beverages as much as you like.

Arrived early baggage already waiting in the arrivals area after disembarking. So efficient.

We printed our boarding cards at home but still queued for almost an hour at Gatwick to check bags in. Very slow service and only 4 desks open of a possible 20. Staff were available calling customers on flights departing before ours so that was something but more staff required at bag drop for sure!

710,"The quality of the flight was quite good, especially the meals. The seat was comfortable if sitting upright but less comfortable if you are trying to recline for your night sleep. Overhead storage cabins are sufficient unless your fellow passengers are selfish and store too much there. Plenty of leg room even if I store my bags up front (talking about the window seats though). Service quality by the staff (attitude, promptness and helpfulness) was 4 out of 5. As for meals I was highly impressed because of their setting.  Metal cutlery (not plastic), menu to read, delicate desserts, and nice dishware. Other than that, the food is OK, the dinner being good while breakfast was  poor.

When another passenger asked a crew member for me to close my window blind she informed him that it is a daytime flight and that I can keep my window open if I wished.

Good 1-2-1 seat configuration and calming mood lighting including little stars on the ceiling. Efficient obliging crew. Good food.

Inflight entertainment on the boring side but no problem for such a short flight. I did like it. What lets them down is the awful administration it takes ages to reach someone by phone and their so called call centre puts you on a loop whenever you are calling. So for me it was thumbs up for the flight and thumbs down for the admin.,1,"Windhoek-Cape Town returns in May. The flying product of Air Namibia is indeed very good.

731,Business Class LHR-CPT during the snow crisis at Heathrow Airport our booking was for the 20th Dec the first SAA CPT flight out of Heathrow for 4 days. We boarded the A340-200 at 830pm. At 930pm an announcement from Captain advised that water pipes had become frozen and there was leak in the Cargo area - he assured that engineers would ensure the problem was fixed and we could depart that evening. After 6hrs the aircraft it wasn't looking good we would get away that night during those 6hrs cabin crew were extremely attentive served Dinner to passengers. At 3am Captain announced the fault could not be repaired but he had a choice of either cancelling the flight for a complete repair or could depart with no water for the bathrooms and no hot drinks - passengers would need to be co-operative by using bottles of water to empty into the bathroom so they can flush - passengers agreed and we left at 350am. Bathrooms were clean during the whole flight passengers and crew were brilliant in ensuring no health hazard occured.

734,SYD-ICN-LAX round-trip from 24th June and returned 8th July. Really outstanding staff in all three countries I travelled through whether it be during check in or onboard the flights and felt they truly value their customers. Planes were modern and seats were fantastic on both the 777 and 747. Meals served were excellent especially the Korean option and they even offered some premium red and white wines. Coffee and tea services frequent throughout the flights alongside other refreshments. IFE had impressive big monitors and quality was great.

735,First time user of Ryanair so to be on the safe side booked seats and got priority boarding. We were very surprised at how smoothly everything went. Coming back from Palma it was obvious the people in front of us had used Ryanair before. They were a couple with two children and had put a large bag on the floor with coats on top and got the youngest child to lay on it. The father had another large bag over his shoulder. The Ryanair staff were walking down the line as we were waiting to board with a box the size of what suitcases were allowed a shand luggage but I never saw them check against anybody's luggage. Some of the so called hand luggage was almost as big as my hold suitcase. After we all boarded a young couple squashed into the extra legroom pretending to let people pass by then were amazed that there was no seats left together so they ended up sitting there.

736,KUL-CMB-CDG and return. Excellent service all the way from the ground staff to the most hospitable cabin crew I have ever come across. Serendib Lounge in Colombo is great place to unwind. Meals onboard were sumptuous beyond expectation - especially the spicy Sri Lankan option. Cabin crew are very caring and regularly checks on your comfort and requirements.

737,LGW-MCO-SEA-LHR. Seats booked during Club World sale window - so reasonable priced. Check in at Gatwick very easy and through the fast track in about 5 mins. Boarded on time with short wait before take off. Staff on the outbound leg superb attentive without being intrusive food as ever palatable and overall great trip. Inbound Seattle - Heathrow. Lounge at Seattle is simply too small with insufficient seating however once on plane staff were again excellent although they appeared little rushed when compared with the outbound leg that may simply be because the CW cabin was more full.

Purser looked after BC and PE. Drinks/food service in PE identical to BC. Wouldn't bother paying the additional to travel Business on such a short flight when PE has the same service. Appeared that Economy was not offered an alcohol service. Drinks were acceptable (champagne offered ) and food was above expectations. Neatly packaged tasty and well presented. 2nd beverage service offered with tea/coffee. Nothing seemed rushed on a short flight of 1hr 25mins. Would travel short haul AF Premium Economy again.

742,Bangkok-Helsinki-Riga (BKK-HEL-RIX) in Business Class. As many people mentioned here already the food looks like Economy Class catering it's served in one tray and doesn't look very attractive. Attendants are a little bit cold but otherwise professional. The rest was great clean cabin and toilets friendly pilot good lounge at Helsinki airport. Taking into account the price Finnair's Business Class is surely value for money.

They actually seemed to want the passengers on the plane and to look after us even though it was only a very short flight nothing seemed too much trouble.

745,A340 from Los Angeles to Zurich and return. Major complaint we have is that in economy class the video screens were difficult to see when the passengers in front of us reclined their seats. The screen doesn't tilt enough to compensate for the angle change created by reclining seats. We were unable to watch movies due to poor visibility. The video system seemed old and mine froze on me a couple of times and had to be rebooted.

748,Have flown several times between Lagos domestic (Old terminal) and Warri. Flights on time and flight attendants attentive and friendly. Be warned that you'll have to hunt down your gate at Lagos if you want to be sure of catching your flight. It's not unusual for staff to just wander off for no announcements to be made and for passengers to be running across the runway at the last minute with their baggage in hand. On one occasion a Dutch wetlease service was used from Warri to Lagos older but it was a comfortable plane with one Dutch and one Nigerian FA both friendly and professional. The safety briefing was even done a second time as one passenger point blank refused to pay attention the first time and wouldn't remove their earphones. Food onboard constituted a carton of five alive juice and either a pain au chocolate or the standard Nigerian mystery meat pasty. Good luck with that one. Security at Warri as corrupt as anywhere else in Nigeria. Despite the airport being funded by Shell don't expect any special attention if you work for them though here they are particularly aggressive rather than the usual passive begging.,1,"I have flown between Lagos Inland (Old Terminal) and Warri several times.

The safety briefing was even carried out a second time because a passenger did not want to pay attention the first time and did not remove the headphones. The food on board consisted of a carton of five live juices and either a chocolate bar or the usual Nigerian mystery meat pie. Good luck with that. Security in Warri is more corrupt than anywhere else in Nigeria.

Despite flying to airports that only the CIA has heard of and advertising the airport for the capital city of Slovenia (it's Bratislava) as Vienna it's very handy. I use it often and I have never had a problem with Ryanair. Even with hidden fees tickets for me seem cheaper than Aer Lingus. The aircraft are clean but still somewhat dark and gloomy and the seats are uncomfortable horrible on a late-night flights or dawn when you try and catch some sleep however still possible.

The food was good and in adequate portions although drink runs were not frequent and you had to wait a while as there was only 1 cart serving the whole of economy section per aisle. Although they do walk around with a bottle of water. Snacks were given out in generous quantities package in a lovely bag. On all flights seats and legroom were comfortable. The negatives are probably the seat which cannot be recline and the movies which are limited and repetitive in other languages. The domestic flight had no entertainment but a live feed showing the take off and landing which was quite a change.

The ticket was the cheapest I could find. I have flown on several different airlines and United served me one of the best meals I have ever had on a plane. The seats were big and comfortable since United has a good seat configuration. United uses a 3-3-3 seat configuration unlike many airlines that uses a 3-4-3 configuration on their Boeing 777's.

760,NYC-ICN on A380 ICN-BKK on 747. Upper deck on A380 just doesn't feel special way too large much prefer the feel of Korean Air 777. As usual some problems being understood by the crew but overall good. Bar at front and back totally pointless. Ugly to look at and limited drinks. Not somewhere you really want to sit. Painless 50min transfer at Seoul. 747 older product with old style angled seating but for shorter flight was ok.,1,"NYC-ICN on A380 ICN-BKK on 747.

761,Lisbon-Warsaw. Check-in smooth Fast Track through security off to the TAP Lounge which is quite small even though it looks big because of mirrors used. At this time lounge was very crowded so I had to stand at the bar. Flight was surprisingly on time on A319. Nice and professional cabin crew full service including hot meal and full bar service. Arrived 25 mins ahead of schedule. TAP offers decent consistent service the only down point is that they always start meal/drinks service after reaching cruising altitude which in some cases is after 1-1.5 hrs after take off! This time first carts arrived after 1hr 25 mins after departure no cabin crew visible before that! Ridiculous!,1,"Lisbon-Warsaw.

762,Air Asia Indonesia. QZ8322 21 Mar 2014 DMK-CGK (A320). Website check-in is convenient check-in agents are good and smiling and oblige if you want to change to an Aisle seat. Boarding in DMK is Manual and the staff check recheck and re- recheck if you have boarded or not. Crew welcoming and point to your seat. Announcements so fast no one can understand them. Safety demonstrations are very good and clear to the point. Food looks like it has been recycled on 2 or more flights I had pre-booked meal (Pak Nassers Nasi Lemak) as I'm allergic to fish however the meal included Anchovies. Again on landing the announcements were so fast that we all just looked at each other in a daze. Overall I will fly them again but will bring my own food and water.,1,"Air Asia Indonesia.

763,I flew from Orlando to Amsterdam in premium comfort class. The flight was actually pretty good. It was on time convenient priced right service was good and the food not too bad. If you compare it to the major long haul carriers ie Delta Lufthansa Virgin etc you will find some areas that do not compare..ie the seats only recline they do not lie flat no power for computers older planes and basic service is offered not over the top like some carriers. I would recommend this carrier as a low cost alternative to the big airline companies.,1,"I flew in premium comfort class from Orlando to Amsterdam. The flight was actually pretty good.

765,BHX-GVA-BHX. Another great flight with Easyjet. Checked in and printed my boarded passes at home so just had to drop my suitcase at Birmingham which took around 5 minutes. I like that Easyjet now allocate your seats although they still call the flight very early presumably to ensure everyone is at the gate ready for boarding. Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.,1,"BHX-GVA-BHX. Another great flight with Easyjet.

767,Flew outward BCN-SIN via Milan as part of a MAD-KUL journey. For reasons we still can't understand at check-in in at MAD Air Europa checked our bags through to SIN only and couldn't issue boarding passes beyond BCN. We had to check in again at BCN which proved a blessing in disguise as SIA impressed us by unprompted noting that our bags weren't checked through to KL and organising that for us. Flight was on time and reasonably comfortable (on 777) crew handled some noisy adjacent passengers well by taking time to circle the cabin rather than going to them directly with our complaint. Food was OK; although obviously partly serviced from Milan with some uninspiring Italian products. Drinks came with good frequency although self-service option overnight especially for water might be better. Back SIN-LHR on A380. Again check-in staff did well readily changing our seat allocation to what we preferred. Flight delayed mostly by re-routing 75 minutes causing some stress over connections in London - no information offered on those at all. Service OK with choice of three meals (against only two outbound). Breakfast could do with better bakery selection but hot choices both OK. Strange that despite the one hour delay it was offered a good 2.5 hours before arrival (ie 3.30 in the morning London time) and in a vary patchy fashion with different parts of the cabin served seemingly at random. IFE worked OK on both flights lots of channels although not everything on them appears on the menus which is confusing. Wifi offered on A380 but pay as you go so no experience of that. In all entirely satisfactory product but not outstanding or memorable although customer care at check-in was well beyond usual experience.,1,"BCN-SIN flew beyond Milan as part of a MAD-KUL trip.

Super friendly on-board staff and top-notch gate people who are all an asset to the United team at both the EWR and MEX stations.

770,I flew with Thomson Airways on the 15th July and the 25th July 2015. Both aircrafts were Boeing 737-800 and both flights left on time.

771,BHX-CDG-BHX. Outbound flight fine on time and good service on board consisted of complimentary snack and drink. Plane was an Embraer type narrow body with a 2x2 configuration.

772,This airline gave me what I was looking for - an inexpensive way to get me from point A to point B. Due to maintenance problems we were held up for 4 hrs but that tells me they're more concerned with their safety record than their on-time record. They gave a voucher for a meal at the terminal. The seats were fairly close together but not horribly so. The desk staff and flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Good solid flight with a worthy aircraft.

773,Value for money this was one of the best airline experiences I've had. Check in on both sides was fine. The premium plus with an equivalent fair to most airlines economy comfort was a far better value. Definitely more room and more comfortable seating than comparable airlines offerings. While their fleet of 757's are not new and not glamorous it was better than most international business class of 5 to 10 years ago. Considering you only pay a couple of hundred dollars more then a regular coach (sardine) class and $2-$3000 less in business class it is hard to beat this airline. Also the fact that fly to Orly as opposed to Charles de Gaulle makes transportation into the center of Paris much more economic.,1,"The value for money was one of the best experiences I have had with the airline.

776,My family and I flew from Manchester on TCX472 on the 2nd of August with Thomas Cook to Orlando MCO for the first time. We've previously flown to the same location with Virgin. We tried booking with them again but the price had really increased from the last time we flew in 2011. Thomas Cooks price was practically the same as I paid in 2011 even with two of us having extra legroom as an option! OK the TC price didn't include food and entertainment but even taking that into account we still were £500 better off. I did worry a little when I looked at the mixed reviews. I've only flown the premier carriers before like BA and Virgin so expected the worse! I needn't have! Despite airport security being really bad at each ends the flight in between was really good. The reviews go on about the seats being hard and cramped but I found them acceptable. I'm a big guy and I coped. Sitting down in most seats for over 9 hours is uncomfortable. My family sat in the standard seats and my brother and I sat in ones with extra legroom. After our last time to MCO on a Virgin jumbo we thought the idea of alternating was worth the extra money but nobody needed to move they found the standard legroom ok. The flight crew were excellent. They were attentive and very approachable. I noticed that one of the stewardesses made a real effort to keep the families with little children comfortable which made all the difference. They also came around regularly and took away rubbish. Last time I flew to Orlando with Virgin I literally had to wade through empty bottles papers and magazines to get off! We opted not to have the food because to be frank I don't like eating with knives and forks in cramped conditions so bought sandwiches and drinks at the airport. The entertainment was ok even though you have to pay for the head sets and movies! The highlight of the trip was when we landed at Orlando. We spent 100 minutes going through US immigration but I felt sorry for the Virgin passengers who were behind us! Nice one Thomas Cook! All in all I would rank them better value for money than Virgin based on my trip. We will fly with them again!,1,"My family and I flew to Orlando from Manchester on August 2 with Thomas Cook. We flew with Virgin to the same place before. We tried again with bookings, but the price had really gone up since the last flight in 2011.

OK, the price of the room didn't include food and entertainment, but even taking that into account, we were still £500 better off. I was a little worried when I looked at the mixed reviews. I only flew with the leading airlines, BA and Virgin, so I expected the worst! I don't have to! Although the airport security situation was really bad at both ends, the flight in between was really good. The reviews go on that the seats are hard and cramped, but I found them acceptable. I'm a big guy and I got on with it. Sitting in most seats for more than nine hours is uncomfortable. My family were in the normal seats and my brother and I were in those with more legroom. After our last visit to MCO in a Virgin jumbo, we thought the idea of changing was worth the extra money, but no one had to move, they found normal legroom fine.

779,Just took my third return flight to Guadalajara Mexico on Volaris. Our most recent flight was LAS-GDL. Volaris makes no bones about being a low cost carrier but they do provide free cocktails and more than the normal number of snacks. Flight crew is well dressed and very attentive. They have recently revised baggage allowances but do offer fair pricing for additional baggage if you take the option when booking. Our only objection is the manner in which they physically search luggage prior to actual check in at the airport in Guadalajara.

Best option in domestic flights but average or below average on International flights. Agree with some reviews: Stewardesses disappeared once the first meal was served they look like they don't enjoy the job one of them asked me in a rude way to put down the entertainment screen (while counterparts in domestic flights do this for you).

786,Just travelled from Newcastle to Sanford with Thomson on the Dreamliner and experience was mixed. Plane was spacious clean and comfortable which was exactly what was promised. Cabin and flight crew on the way out were friendly helpful and informative with a very smooth flight and as a nervous flyer this was a great start to the holiday. The only downside was that 2 of the 5 entertainment systems did not work which made it difficult to entertain 3 excited children. The crew were clearly harassed as this appeared to the case across the plane and despite numerous attempts to reset the system our TVs did not co-operate. I have contacted Thomson to complain but no response to date. The return flight was a different experience we heard from the flight crew at the start and end of the journey but despite constant turbulence throughout the majority of the flight and the seatbelt sign being on there was deafening silence from the flight crew. This caused additional anxiety as it would only have taken a moment for someone to say don't worry this is normal. The flight crew were pleasant and efficient rather than friendly which was a marked difference from the crew going out. Despite a tailwind of over 150 mph for a large portion of the flight we were slightly delayed but overall the Dreamliner lived up to expectations.,1,"Thomson has just taken the Dreamliner from Newcastle to Sanford and the experience has been mixed. The plane was spacious, clean and comfortable, which was exactly what was promised.

The flight attendants were pleasant and efficient rather than friendly, which made a clear difference to the crew that went out.

787,We flew from Birmingham to Sharm on 25th January. Check in was quick and easy. We had booked extra leg room seats and I'm pleased we did because passengers in economy section looked extremely cramped. Flight departed on time and we actually arrived early. Cabin service was good throughout but if you get hungry I would suggest that you avoid the toasted sandwich - it was like chewing on two pieces of burnt cardboard. Return flight on 4th Feb was delayed by about 40 minutes. Service okay and we would probably use Monarch again - but only if we could get extra leg room seats.,1,"We flew from Birmingham to Sharm on January 25. Check-in was quick and easy.

788,KUL to MEL. Check-in at LCCT was a breeze but lack of Duty Free shops at midnight was a minus. A330-330 nicely cushioned seats. Crews professional and friendly.

789,SFO-AKL round-trip. Seat pitch adequate for my 6'1' husband but footrest is useless does not come up high enough for anyone. Recline adequate for nap. Attentive staff. Meals well presented and fairly good. Entertainment system needs refurbishment remotes in both directions needed work and sound wasn't working properly in my seat on the return. I'm pretty sure that they used the same equipment on the outbound flight as I heard a person in my (future) seat making the same complaint about the sound on the outbound leg and wasn't surprised (but was disappointed) to discover that it had not been fixed a week later (or if fixed broke again already).

791,LHR-VIE-LHR 29/12/12 and 1/1/13. Excellent product in Business Class. Flights on time boarding perfect in flight service friendly and accomplished on both legs. Food by Do & Co lives up to the long haul experience and plentiful. My only quibble is that the Captain takes an awful long time to switch off the seatbelt sign so long on the return flight (after 30 mins climbing and in calm air) that the senior crew member had to go into the cockpit to check whereupon the seat belt sign was switched off immediately and service began. Excellent food and drinks as usual by Austrian. One complaint: on return flight to LHR cabin lights did not get switched on after take off on questioning this was told that there were approx 100 Japanese pax who'd transferred from a day flight from Japan and requested a dark flight. Cabin crew member for business pax rightly asked if I wanted lights switched on I said no but did think that on a short 2hr flight to London not acceptable for a group to dictate the lighting on a plane - but sympathise with Austrian if this is a regular and lucrative booking! All in all Austrian remains a quality European airline in Business Class well worth flying.,1,"LHR-VIE-LHR 29 / 12 / 12 and 1 / 1 / 13. Excellent product in Business Class.

Excellent food and drinks as always from Austrians. One complaint: On the return flight to LHR, the cabin lights were not switched on after take-off during an interview. It was reported that about 100 Japanese had switched from a day flight from Japan and had requested a dark flight.

792,Tallinn-Amsterdam is a short flight but crew were nice helpful and were able to understand at least 4 languages (they helped my Dutch Grandmother who speaks no English). Amenities not normally provided but because flight was near empty they gave out snacks plus complementary tea and coffee. They also allowed us to sit in vacant seats which was nice. In general a nice trip and much more than was expected for basically a regional airline.,1,"Tallinn-Amsterdam is a short flight, but the crew was nice and helpful and could understand at least 4 languages (they helped my Dutch grandmother who does not speak English).

793,Generally excellent courteous service but Entertainment system which offers a vast selection of films is the only downside to the flight. I am constantly pointing out to the flight crew out of every 4 flights I take on SIA I will experience problems with the entertainment system on at least 3. If not complete breakdown it is usually a problem with âstuttering (picture freezes and then catches up but cutting out parts of the film in the process) and/or the sound disappearing half way through a film. My family members share my experience. Consequently the problem is systemic and chronic. The fact that SIA does nothing to improve this demonstrates not only a clear lack of commitment to delivering a seamless enjoyable passenger experience but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who have to spend so much time unnecessarily dealing with passengers complaints. By the way system reboots are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers to put up with. But this seems to be the cheap route they have chosen rather than fixing what is patently broken.,1,"Generally excellent, polite service, but the entertainment system, which offers a wide selection of movies, is the only drawback of the flight. I constantly remind flight staff that I have at least three problems with the entertainment system on every SIA flight that I have flown on 4 times. If not a complete collapse, it is usually a problem with the stuttering (the image freezes and then catches up with parts of the film but cuts them out) and / or the disappearance of the sound halfway through a film.

The SIA's failure to take action to improve this shows not only a clear lack of commitment to a seamless passenger experience, but also a lack of consideration for the flight crew who spend so much time unnecessarily complaining to passengers. By the way, system restarts are a very frustrating and annoying thing for passengers. But this seems to be the cheap way they have chosen instead of repairing what is obviously broken."

799,"The original reservation was SJC–ATL–BCN. Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience.

Although you can no longer call these the ""Queen of the Sky"" they still give a comfortable reassuring ride. Delta can be complimented on upgrading their business class product. The fully flat bet is good. The duvet pillows amenity kit (no pyjamas!) and IFE are all excellent though the noise cancelling headset had connection issues on all flights.

801,We flew economy from Paris to Sydney via Dubai. It was my first time flying with Emirates so I was unsure what to expect. Everything was great! Great seats which recline enough to relax in economy. Enough TV shows and movies which kept me entertained and for my wife who prefers things in Arabic there was also subtitles on mostly everything for her. What we did do to make things a little easier was the first leg Paris to Dubai I purposely selected a flight with the 13 hour layover so we left France in the morning arrived Dubai around 8pm. Explored the shops visited the spa for a massage then stayed in the Airport Hotel over night for our connecting flight the next morning. It was the first time I had done it this way normally just allowing 2-3 hours wait between flights but then usually you are so tired on that second flight you sleep and in economy its not the most comfortable which ever airline you choose as you are not in a lie flat bed.

The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded.

804,"Air Mauritius the cheapest way of getting to Mauritius. PER to SSR must have been the first A330 built seats coming apart - big black box under seat which after reading Skytrax is the ""entertainment"" box - it did not have much in it - only one movie that was worth watching. The staff appeared so uninterested - I would suggest Air Mauritius employ some staff from a country where people want to work. On return I noted that Air Mauritius did have some staff apparently not Mauritian perhaps in an attempt to lift the service standard. Two cups of tea only in a long flight one with UHT milk and one with that chemical called ""Creamer"" so I had coffee instead of tea to hide the revolting taste. Return flight about 90% full.

807,AMS-KUL-PER (Economy) 4 of us flew with Malaysia on a round trip from Amsterdam to Perth during January. The staff and comfort on the planes was excellent and with one exception the food was reasonable. The exception was the breakfast on the last leg. A dish of boiled rice with half a boiled egg embedded and what I took to be a savoury sauce on one side. Having stirred it all together I found that it was a very strong curry/pepper of which I was unable to partake as I am not fond of any curry/pepper meals. Curry for breakfast! Come on Malaysia - surely you can do better. However - the Administration Department of Malaysia Airways is awful. I emailed them 3 times with particular problems and did not even receive acknowledgements. We actually started our journey from Dublin but this was with Aer Lingus and I cannot fault them. However they were unable to issue our Malaysia Boarding Cards and told us this had to be done in Amsterdam. Luckily we hurried to the particular desk as we were fourth in the queue. There was a single lady at the desk and she was taking 15 minutes per client. It had something to do with re-routing late arrivals from the incoming plane onto other flights as they had missed their connections. So after an hour we managed to get our passes. But Amsterdam is a big airport and it takes ages to negotiate so we had to be quick in getting to the gate. The flights on the 777 and 330 were very comfortable though they were not the seats I had originally requested. As I said earlier I cannot fault the staff on board. They were very attentive and came round very regularly with drinks. On the last leg (KUL to AMS) the entertainment to two of our seats did not work well and I could only get music which was not a bother as I do not normally watch movies on a plane. However I did miss the flight progress maps. The staff did try to reset the system (twice) but without success. I have used MAH in the past but this experience has dimmed my enthusiasm for them and I may just decide to change operators for my next flight to Australia.,1,"AMS-KUL-PER (Economy) Four of us flew with Malaysia on a round trip from Amsterdam to Perth in January.

Almost new A320 very quite and smooth. They had a special offer on pre-booked meals so took advantage of the offer. I wasn't expecting much in quality but was pleasantly surprised how good and tasty the whole meal was and it even included a free Kenco coffee which would have cost us £2.50 anyway so for £7.00 excellent value for money. Cabin crew were very attentive and pretty much refrained from the shouting offers that you get on Jet 2 flights. Return flight was affected by ATC strikes but was reassured to receive a text message from Monarch on the morning of departure advising that our flight was still operating although it may be subject to delay. They pulled out all the stops and we returned 2 hours late. This is the first time I have flown with Monarch for quite a few years and they are definitely a cut above other low cost airlines. I just hope that they expand their destinations from Leeds Bradford even more as Jet 2 and their ancient 'planes are becoming too complacent. Well done Monarch and looking forward to flying with you again from LBA to Lanzarote in November.,1,"Excellent flight from Leeds Bradford to Larnaca.

812,I came off my early morning (arriving) flight from Dubai at Heathrow and had to check out and in again as I purchased two separate tickets. I had anticipated a nightmare doing this but it was so simple despite terminal change etc. and the online check in queue had no one even though both Lufthansa and Austrian share the check-in zone. Friendly check in staff. Flight OS452 (anniversary livery A320) was much quieter than I expected and there was one of many spare seats next to me. Reading material was brilliant. The snack was nice as were the drinks which included a range of Austrian drinks such as Almdudler and Julius Meinl coffee. The crew were very friendly and the welcome on board was warm. I always enjoy my trips with Austrian and even though soon I'll be leaving my home in Vienna I hope to use Austrian as my airline for connecting flights in the future.,1,"I arrived at Heathrow early in the morning (arrival) from Dubai and had to check out again as I had bought two separate tickets.

813,"Flew LHR-KUL-PER on MH3 and MH125 with my wife and 2 year old son. Contrary to what I read about MAS' policy on seating children on top deck in economy I was happy that we had been seated there in the middle row of 4 seats. I was even happier when before take off the stewardess moved the gentleman sat next to us to an exit seat so that we all had more room he was also very pleased. The cabin decor I must say is fantastic compared to the SQ route we took last year it is far ahead. Both planes were also in very good condition compared to other airlines on similar routes e.g. EK and SQ. The seats were well designed but as Mr Walsh has pointed out previously they are not as good as the old 747 seats on older MAS flights. I am also 6""3' and we are talking about economy after all so it can only be bearable. The food on the flight was pretty good for economy there were plenty of beverages served throughout the flight and my wife's veg and sons child's meal were always served first and his tray was always cleared before the remainder of the cabin. The only thing that's worth pointing out is that on EK and SQ for such a long flight there is usually a selection of sandwiches to snack on however we were only given chocolate bars and crips which I thought was a bit cheap. Appreciate the airline is struggling financially but I fail to see how depriving passengers on which is already a long and tiring flight a decent snack. The cabin crew were polite but lacked the Malaysian hospitality that I have come to expect from MAS. Having flown with them regularly since 2004 they were not quite up to the previous standard. They were not rude or anything like that just that they were going through their motions as quickly as possible. Considering the cost of the tickets were several hundred pounds less than SQ or EK I would definitely recommend MH.",1,"LHR-KUL-PER flew with my wife and 2-year-old son on MH3 and MH125.

815,I just used Emirates for the trans-Tasman trip from Auckland to Melbourne so benefited from being in a big plane. It was the first time in many years that I actually enjoyed the trans-Tasman flight. Comfortable seat tasty food (real cutlery!) and polite service. Lots of movies and TV programmes to choose from and you had the option of viewing one of three plane cameras which made it interesting. The only downside was having to return the headphones 20 minutes before landing and I hadn't finished watching the movie. A tip to take your own headphones. I would highly recommend Emirates for Aus/NZ flights.,1,I just used Emirates for the transfer from Auckland to Melbourne and so benefited from a big plane.

821,JFK-HKG-CMB 12/18. We purposely like to fly out of JFK to catch Cathay's afternoon non-stop to HKG vs. flying out of LAX (plus get a couple of nights in NYC). Check-in at JFK is with BA. They don't offer any of the special services you find at JAL FC check-in or AA Flagship (an airline employee walks you counter check-in through Security to the Lounge). Priority TSA is not available at the early afternoon hour. Luckily regular security did not have long lines. Cathay uses the BA FC Lounge which is not special and needs a major refurb. The 777-300 had Cathay's new refreshed FC cabin. The flight is so special it makes up for the mediocre airport experience. The FAs are simply the best. Lunch and dinner meal services on this 16+ hour flight can't be beat. The menu has a wide variety of choices. I had the lamb which was perfectly cooked to my requested preference medium rare. Turn down service PJs (an upgraded PJ very comfortable) and inflight entertainment are the best of the Asian carriers.

822,Singapore to Japan on a late night flight 11pm to 9am. I was surprised that the drinks service was reduced to being given a choice of juice water or beer from trays instead of the full drinks cart service. I got what I requested when I asked for it specifically. The menu card provided listed that a selection of snacks are available upon request before breakfast. When I asked what the options were the stewardess gave me a few pieces of tiny biscuits. On the way back the stewardess gave me the option of instant noodles or biscuits. I wonder if these are cost cutting measures. The new advertisements portrayed better service though hence I was disappointed. Air France and KLM offers a much better snack selection of chocolates fruits sandwiches cakes throughout their flight.

824,Glasgow - Orlando in April 2015 with return flight early May. I chose to write this review because so many I have read have suggested a horrible experience. That was not the case for my family and I albeit our flights were only half full both ways which I'm sure helped the experience. First things first though: the cons. After booking our tickets and waiting for seat reservations to open up we found out that to reserve a seat cost money (£25-£35 with the higher cost for extra legroom or an exit row). This seemed scandalous to us especially on a transatlantic flight. However we chose to reserve an exit row at a cost of £210 in total for 3 of us to have the same seats there and back. The only thing I'd say about this is forearmed is forewarned we had not appreciated that was the case when we booked. Would it effect our decision in the future? Probably not because we wanted to fly direct to Orlando rather than via London (or another UK airport). You can of course wait until 24 hours before you fly but then you are a hostage to fortune in terms of where you might be. We chose seats on the upper deck and this is something I would recommend. It's smaller therefore quieter and there are two bathrooms for a cabin that houses no more than 60 so it's easier to access too. I can't fault the staff who were attentive throughout. Food was ok - this is economy - and we got drinks as often as we wanted (which wasn't a great deal but it was never any trouble to staff to accommodate our needs). The in-flight entertainment system was very good with plenty of movies to keep me entertained for an 8-hour flight. All in all I would fly Virgin again based on this experience but it would be in the knowledge that to get a seat I wanted - I much prefer an aisle seat on a long flight - the 'true' cost would be £50-£70 more expensive than the original purchase price and that is something I would take into account when looking at other airlines.,1,"Glasgow - Orlando in April 2015 with return flight in early May.

825,Glasgow to and from Exeter. Bag drop at Glasgow was swift but manual as both check in kiosks had failed. Boarding was accomplished quickly and efficiently for both flights and the aircraft were clean and tidy on boarding. Both flights departed on time and arrived slightly early although passengers were held on board for some time at Exeter as passengers boarded the aircraft on an adjacent stand.

827,San Diego-LHR-MAN. On 6th January we flew from San Diego to Manchester UK via Heathrow. After flying out on Christmas Day via LAX on the A380 this flight was a welcome return to form for BA's Club World offering. The San Diego Admiral's Club lounge is currently undergoing refurbishment but is still a nice space and unlike the UK lounges upon arrival we were offered a menu not just a 'self serve' buffet. When it came time to board this was a much smoother experience than our previous flight on the A380 the staff at San Diego had the boarding area well organised and once club passengers were called we were on the aircraft glass of bubbly in hand in minutes. The cabin crew were much friendlier and professional than those on the outward flight as this is smaller cabin with fewer passengers you definitely felt that you were the 'premium' customer your ticket price would suggest and nothing was too much trouble. Drinks were constantly topped up food was excellent and the cabin crew were chatty and friendly. The entertainment system might not have been quite as impressive as on the A380 but considering we slept for a large portion of this 10 hour flight that was unimportant. After a very average outward flight on the A380 into LA this superb flight home on the smaller aircraft restored my faith in BA's club offering and means that for future trips to the West Coast we will be flying direct into San Diego rather than LAX.,1,"San Diego-LHR-MAN.

The Singapore to Perth leg was not what you would expect from Singapore Airlines. The crew were really rushing everything. Not sure why as it was 5 hour flight.

Nice uniforms. Excellent professional conduct by cabin crew. Aircraft was clean. We had seat 17E & 17D seats were comfortable. Cabin service was very efficient for this short flight. My only disgruntle with Jetstar is when doing you own online web check in if you want to change the seat you have been allocated you are charged $5 per person for a standard seat and more for a better seat such as wanting more leg room. This is the first time since I have been flying with Jetstar this has occurred. By doing my own online web check in I have actually saved Jetstar money by them not having to employ extra check in staff. I don't feel it is fair for the airline to charge extra for you wanting to choose your own seat. They never did this in the past. With the new 7kg carry on board luggage only rule if you are a female passengers be aware that if carrying on board luggage only they will weigh both your on board luggage and hand bag together. If you are over the 7kg limit with both items you will be charged extra. So if you are a female you will be disadvantaged as most women carry heavy hand bags. I have not come across this on a Jetstar flight in the past. Overall a very good flight and this is a very good low cost carrier. Would recommend to others but will warn them of these new changes.,1,"16 / 5 / 15 JQ785 ADL-MEL Airbus A320. Another very good flight with Jetstar.

Airplanes were clean. We had 17E seats and 17D seats were comfortable. The cabin service was very efficient for this short flight.

843,"I was surprised to find that Spirit was fine for the short flight I took. I'm 5'10"" and had no problems whatsoever getting comfortable in the economy seats. The plane was clean enough, and flight crew all very friendly. My flight did get delayed both coming and returning to Chicago, so be prepared for delays (avoid Spirit if you're dealing with any connecting flights). Here's my overall takeaway from flying Spirit: 90% of your experience will be just like any other airline you've ever flown. There's no food (but do I really want airline food anyway? no.) Seats are ever so slightly smaller. You've got to pay for all carryons and checked bags. If you don't need to bring a big bag, be happy you don't have to pay for it. If you need to bring a big bag, then you'll just have to pay for it. I think it's fair.

848,"First Class on a 787 from Guangzhou to Vancouver. Airport check-in was good. The China Southern Lounge is far below the standard for 4 star airlines. It is very small and only has tables and chairs. There is food available including 2 freshly made hot dishes to order. The beverages are average. This is not to say that it is not comfortable and there is wif-fi. But compared to what I would consider 4-star ""standard"" such as ANA United etc. is does not come near that. There is only one row of First Class seating on the 787 and the seats were semi-pod. They did go fully flat and were comfortable for sleeping though if you are over 6 ft. tall you might find them a bit short. In the non-bed position they were comfortable though they do not really have foot rests - the leg rests stop mid-calf. There is a small shelf at the far end of the pod that does work so I would say the seating is quite adequate. VOD was in my opinion quite good with a large selection of Hollywood European Asian and Chinese films and lots of TV music and games options. The only negative is that the screen is fixed at the opposite end of the pod from the seat so it's a bit far away. The English proficiency of the cabin staff is not great so asking for anything that isn't in a narrow band of expectations can lead to confusion or your not getting what you wanted. This was as basic in my case as asking if they had any type of drinks beside red and white wine. Ends up they did but it took the purser to recognize my request. She then provided an extensive list of the drinks available on board which was very good. The food was good as well - no complaints. The staff was also quite attentive and ready to please. If you care about the sleeping suit I found it sized quite small.

862,BA873 KRK-LHR 17 May - a new sector launched just early this month and my first time flying BA. I was pleasantly surprised (for my friend) that he was able to check-in his big carry-on for free while I paid for check-in luggage. I understood why in the end. My biggest gripe has to be that the Sunday flight departs and arrives late into LHR. This was worsened by the fact that it was a full flight but the overhead bins were already full before all were on board hence there was a 20 minute delay on the tarmac as remaining hand-carry luggage had to be put in the hold. Unfortunately flight did not manage to catch up while in the air hence we landed 20 minutes late cutting it close to the curfew time for LHR. We had to run all the way through and almost missed the last Heathrow Express train. I will never fly a late flight into LHR again. That said the pilot and cabin crew were entertaining - quite chatty over the PA and with some passengers though not necessarily friendly to all customers. 2.5 hours on an A320 passed by without any in-flight entertainment (to be expected for regional flights) and with some food and refreshments (which were good).,1,"BA873 KRK-LHR May 17 - a new sector was introduced only earlier this month and I flew BA for the first time.

871,Istanbul to Washington TK007 on Nov 272014. Flight was not full and I had 3 seats to myself in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms and food cart storage closets.

872,I had a flight from Miami to Washington Dulles with Frontier. When I searched on google I was a little worried when I booked this flight since the price was only half compared to those of other airlines (even after adding the baggage fee). But nothing was wrong. Perfect flight. Take off and landing on time. Check-in fast. Baggage fast. I have nothing to complain. That they charge for the baggage and the food is quite normal in my opinion. The prices for those services are reasonable. If you accept the cheap airplane tickets they provide that is part of the additional costs one has to accept too.

903,I flew from Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda in First. The Concorde Lounge at Heathrow was quite good though I was surprised by how little choice there was when it came to food. The seat on the new First was good. The service was all right. The food on board was poor as it has been each time I've flown First over the years.

Customs clearance at Bangkok Don Mueang was also efficient. On the return journey in August my wallet was stolen at Don Mueang and Airasia held the plane for 20 minutes while their staff assisted with a search.

909,London Stansted to Tbilisi Georgia via Istanbul return. I was relieved to find a normal airport check-in with allocated seats and 20kg checked baggage allowance at no extra cost and 8kg hand baggage. London to Istanbul was slightly late but no problem as I was using the Servisair lounge adjacent to the gate. All other flights on time. The long layover each way at Istanbul's modern Sabiha Gökçen (SAW) airport was the worst part especially as neither of the lounges accepted Priority Pass but helpful staff at Gloria Jean's Coffees allowed me to plug my laptop into their power and there was wireless available. Hilarious safety video featuring children – a great idea because you just have to watch it. Planes modern and clean. I learned here that on-board prices are high so I ate and drank before the flights. Unlike others I had no problems with cancellations. So far as I am concerned this is a budget airline which is much better than that very arrogant one which I could Harp on about.,1,"London Stansted to Tbilisi Georgia via Istanbul.

916,We flew business from Melbourne to Bangkok via Brunei within the last month. Decided to fly business as the price was better than others on the same route. In perspective it offered good service for the money. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne is adequate and comfortable. On boarding you are offered a drink (non-alcoholic of course) and hot (very hot) towel. Shortly after take off you are given a menu to mark what you want and then offered a series of magazines etc. The entertainment system worked fine the selection adequate. Meals were huge you could have five courses then snacks also if you wished. The service was excellent going with less in the cabin (business) but coming back it was full and the two people serving were struggling. I asked for a duvet instead of a meal coming back and I was eventually given that when the meal service was complete which was not my aim (I wanted to sleep through service). Anyway it was fine really the price was right and it was a comfortable easy flight. The staff are very nice Brunei airport is small but functional.

From a negative point of view the carry on baggage is very restrictive (just 6kg) you have to pay for inflight meals and you also have to pay for headphones for the in flight entertainment. You can get round this last part by bringing your own on the flight. However the airline is clean and has real character.

935,Have flown Aegean several times to Chania via Athens. Returned on Friday 24th August. We had booked a flight from Chania to Athens due to depart at 11.20. We eventually took off at 12.10 no explanation given. We were really worried as our connecting Aegean flight from Athens to Heathrow was leaving at 13.30! We landed in Athens at 13.15 and still did not know whether we would catch our flight as the stewardess said we could ask once we landed it did not lend itself to a smooth flight experience. However what happened next deserves a gold star: an Aegean representative met us as we came off the plane and escorted us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security onto our London flight which took off as soon as we were on board at 1335. Amazing! And what is even more amazing is that our luggage was also found and secured onto our flight. Excellent recovery by Aegean.,1,"I have flown to Chania several times via Athens. Return on Friday, August 24. We had booked a flight from Chania to Athens, which was due to depart at 11.20 a.m. We finally took off at 12.10 p.m. without any explanation. We were really worried when our connecting flight from Athens to Heathrow departed at 1.30pm! We landed in Athens at 1.15 pm and still did not know whether we would catch our flight, as the stewardess said we could ask him after landing, which was not suitable for a smooth flight experience. What happened next deserves a golden star: A representative of the Aegean Sea met us as we left the plane and accompanied us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security checks on our London flight, which took off immediately after 1335 on board.

936,Flew BNE-LAX-JFK on Sat 9 May 2015 and returned on Mon 18 May 2015 (arriving in Brisbane on Wed 20 May 2015). Three of the four sectors experienced delays - engine trouble airport congestion and fog. Qantas kept us informed of the situations in each case but this added hours onto already long sectors. Next time I will stop over in LA in case of delays and to break up the long journey. On each sector I had a spare seat next to me (on the aisle of the four middle seats) which makes a huge difference in comfort. Each sector was flown in a 747 Jumbo - only one sector was on an unrefurbished plane. Ashtrays in the toilet make me giggle. Happy with the flight attendants service food and entertainment. LAX airport has been refurbished since I was last there in 2010 and is a much happier experience. JFK Terminal 7 prior to security has no cafes restaurants etc so don't plan on sitting at the airport for any length of time before checking in. I have been a QFF for 20 years and I will continue to be loyal to them.,1,"Flee to BNE-LAX-JFK on May 9, 2015 and returned on May 18, 2015 (arriving in Brisbane on May 20, 2015).

937,Just returned from Miami (Sunday) had super flight attendants. Have had to put 1 star for inflight entertainment as my earphones could not be used (fault with arm console).

938,"Flew from Melbourne-Adelaide return a few days ago. Just an hour's flight no entertainment going but coming back we were expected to have downloaded their app to access entertainment - no big deal for an hour's flight.

Not sure why she felt the need to state the former if the latter was all that was needed. Instead it just left a ""bad service"" taste in my mouth that was totally unnecessary.

The plane was a slightly aged 737-400. At first the seats seem okay but they hardly recline and there is no adjustable headrests. This makes the seats unsuitable for sleeping in. There was also a lot less legroom than I was expecting. I wouldn't recommend putting a bag under the seat in front of you unless it is very small. Since it was morning we were served breakfast. Our drinks were served first along with the standard snack bag that's also served in coach. Then the meals were served. The meal was an egg and bacon French toast sandwich.

948,"Last week I flew Ryanair for the first time. I didn't expect much from low-cost so I wasn't disappointed in any sense. The flight was from Gdansk to Stansted. I purchased priority service and 15 kg hold bag allowance. At check in desk they spent 5 minutes checking my documents since not many non-eu travelers use this service. They even printed me a ""conventional"" boarding pass. At the gate there was an expected 15 min wait in a crowd on the stairs leading to apron. Not pleasant for parents with crying children all around but bearable for solo traveler. A short walk to the plane then got to my seat. Since it was an exit seat can't say anything about standard legroom. What I had was fine. No seat recline. The seat was ok. Announcements were not noisy. Flight took off late and landed before schedule. I didn't buy anything onboard. Long walk on arrival. Bag on the belt when I was off the immigration. Don't have an idea what if things went wrong but what I got for my money was predictable and trouble free.

951,I've flown long haul with Virgin and their Premium Economy product is excellent but Air New Zealand's just takes it that one notch above (although it does cost slightly more too). Firstly the seat - it's in a shell so the seat tilts and slides rather than reclines into the space behind you. You're also angled slightly and so if you're in the outer seats you're not obliged to talk to the person next to you - it's your own personal space. I paid the extra for seats at the front of the cabin and they're well worth the upgrade - so much legroom and easy to get in and out (useful if travelling solo). The centre seats are better for couples as you can share the space. Check their website for information. The food was excellent served on crockery with metal cutlery. You'll get your starter etc first and wait some time for the hot meal meanwhile your dessert is also sat in front of you being very tempting! The hot food was good although the menu options were a little unusual - both times I went for the fish as the other options (beef and chicken) contained various things I didn't care for. The service was impeccable - the staff were very friendly except one attendant who seemed a little off although still professional. Inflight entertainment is on a decent sized touch screen although there is also a remote in the side of the seat. The selection was surprising - there were a large number of retro movies rather than all the latest blockbusters (of which there were few). However this was actually quite nice as I watched a few older favourites rather than having to gamble on new choices. My favourite thing about the IFE was being able to order drinks and snacks from the screen. Just tap an option or two and it's delivered to your seat a few minutes later whilst you continue to watch your movie. All seats have USB sockets for charging and I think you can link them up to a USB drive but I didn't test this. Also charging sockets are available for your laptop. You can use a standard UK plug as well as US and some other options. The toilets! Firstly two toilets dedicated to Premium Economy - so no queuing. And they were the best - fancy wallpaper with funny fake bookshelves on it (read some of the titles) and music piped in too. Frankly I would pay the upgrade just for those! Finally when flying to the USA you are right near the front of the plane so you're off quickly and can hot foot it to immigration to hopefully beat the queues. Unless you have ridiculously high standards of what you expect from a metal tube flying through the air I don't think you'll be disappointed.,1,"I've flown long-haul on Virgin and their premium economy product is excellent, but Air New Zealand takes it up a notch (though it costs a bit more too).

952,Booked several weeks in advance for a trip from Minot ND to Las Vegas. We paid for advanced seat selection and a checked luggage item at the time of booking. The Allegiant website and online check-in app were incredibly easy and intuitive. I did have difficulty getting the boarding pass to load with the app at first but a couple of tries later it worked. The check in agent in Minot wore a Frontier Airlines uniform and generally was kind of ignorant. The Minot terminal was very cold. The flight was delayed briefly for an issue with an inbound passenger but eventually left about 20 minutes late. Flight was uneventful and went by quickly. I found the MD-83 to be actually quite comfortable even though the seats didn't recline. There was no inflight entertainment system but the onboard magazine was decent and even contained Vegas coupons! We arrived only a little late. The crew was efficient and friendly and even cracked a couple jokes over the PA on arrival and bags dispensed quickly. On the return flight check-in and boarding were pleasant and quick and we left on time. The airplane however was absolutely filthy! The seats were worn the tray tables were slopped all over and even the window had food on it. We had the same crew situation as outbound in that they were efficient friendly and helpful. On arrival to Minot we were early but luggage took 30 minutes to dispense. In the end yes this airline is acceptable. They're certainly inexpensive and the crews are on par with most other carriers. If you want to save up to a few hundred dollars I'm sure you can put up with buying your soda onboard.,1,"Booked several weeks in advance for a trip from Minot ND to Las Vegas.

954,Going to Copenhagen (Economy) seats were tight but that's what I paid for. Service and food okay. Certainly not rude but not very many smiles. Movies okay.

955,I've flown EVA regularly over the last 2 years - premium economy for this last flight. Only relatively good value nowadays as other carriers are getting closer.

And being a night flight to BKK is great and getting back to LHR in the evening is also good. My biggest gripe?

956,Singapore to Perth. Checked in 30 minutes early no problem.

Boarded plane easily not sure if announcer asked Scoot Biz to board but we got on with no issues. Comfort in seats good I would rate cabin and seats as comparable with premium economy as I've travelled business and generally seats are much wider. Service was good with getting water at start of flight and meal promptly after take off. Would be good to get another drink later in flight to make it more biz style. My big issue was with taking my own laptop on and not getting it to work I downloaded at home before going but could not get it working. My advice hire a tablet for $20 or take your own entertainment. It's a shame as this was the only negative of the experience. Flights all good on timings.

962,We flew (family of 5) from BUD to DXB. Check in was busy but efficient and we booked priority boarding and the option of buying an empty seat space for several of us ensuring we all had room. This is an excellent offer that may not be available on all flights but the option always remains to go for the exit seats which offer more space. All of the hassle we witnessed at the airport was due to passenger errors whether trying to book 35kg bags in or taking luggage on board that did not conform to the guidelines which are very clearly outlined on the website. Several passengers did not appear to know whether they had checked in online or not and complained when they were charged the airport fee- again very clearly expressed online. Overall we got way above what was expected. Easy check in good boarding onto a smart newish aircraft good seat room delightful staff without consuming time with many of the unnecessary procedures other airlines insist upon on take off and landing. The staff were helpful attentive and still serving food and drinks 30 mins before arrival. It was a very pleasant experience and we would not hesitate to use Wizz Air again.,1,"We flew (family of five) from BUD to DXB.

971,Heathrow to Colombo (UL504) and return (UL503). Business class on outward leg to take advantage of the flat bed on an overnight flight (7 rows with 2-2-2 configuration i.e. 42 seats all of which were occupied). Tried repeatedly to check in online but got an automated message that this was not possible. BA desk at Manchester confirmed they could not through check pax or luggage. Although the check in with Sri Lankan at HRW was smooth the baggage collection on arrival from Manchester transfer between terminals and so called ‘fast-track’ security was a nightmare taking almost 3 hours. Lounge in LHR Terminal 4 (shared with Gulf Air) was one of the best we have used – spacious and relaxing environment. Boarding was a bit chaotic. Families with children called first no preference given to business class. Onboard service and environment was similar to typical business/club class with many other airlines with the exception of the entertainment system (very limited selection not easy to use poor quality sound). Crew very attentive drinks served frequently good choice of western and Sri Lankan meals for dinner and breakfast. Flat bed was very comfortable. Good Bulgari amenity kit. Returned in economy class (2-4-2 configuration). No queue for check in at Colombo and were allocated requested seats. Surprised that we were automatically through checked to Manchester even though we were overnighting at HRW. CMB airport was a reasonable size with a good selection of shops. Airport has a limited number of toilets and these can be very busy at certain times. Clear boarding announcements. Good welcome and attentiveness from crew. No amenity kit despite this being a 12 hour flight. Seat pitch and width is not significantly better or worse than many scheduled economy seats. There was no foot rest.

My first thoughts were how cabin service reminded me of the economy class I flew as a teenager in the late 1970s. This journey led from the sea to the coast to India and back. Zone 1: Great! The first welcome in the cabin was pleasant and prompt. Seating comfort good. Seat pitch a bit tight. Drinks and snacks service: very good. Flight attendant: If I had my own airline, I would hire every flight attendant I met on this trip. The food was good, no complaints. Entertainment in flight: On the outbound journey, there seemed to be a good selection that I could watch for free on my own device. Connectivity needs to be simplified! On the way back the equipment was Inop. This is the second US aircraft carrier I have met with inflight equipment. United need to spend more time making sure their gear works. ""Only good enough"" is not good enough!"
995,CPT-JNB. Business class seat 2A 737-800 flight lasting just around 2 hours. Seat comfortable similar layout to European airlines for short haul business class. Boarding quick although due to luggage offload flight delayed. Small meal served but nothing like the food served on SAA international flights. Flight arrived on time however spent another 30 min getting to the remote stand and bussed to the terminal which left little time to make my connection. Perhaps not worth the extra from economy fare!,1,"CPT-JNB. Business Class seat 2A 737-800 flight takes only about 2 hours.

998,Flew KHH-HKG-KHH a few weeks ago. The outbound leg was pretty good. Excellent food comfortable seats wonderful service with a smile. They manage to serve a full meal on the very short 1 hour flight which is excellent. On the downside our kids were not served their pre-ordered child meal just the regular adult meal. The deplaning in Hong Kong was via a bus ride. Must be a recent thing as a couple of years ago this flight did use a jetway although at a remote gate. Additionally the airline did not pass around immigration slips and we were turned around at the clearance queue to complete that step. This should be a standard process on any international flight. The return to KHH was messy. The flight was late and the equipment was changed to a Cathay jet. The famous CX/KA food was non-existent and instead we were served chicken wraps and a box of tea. Small detail but takes away from the normally wonderful CX/KA experience.,1,"Flea KHH-HKG-KHH a few weeks ago. The first leg was pretty good.

1001,I had to use Finnair twice within 2 weeks for lack of availability on Lufthansa / SAS flights which I normally use. For good reason. Trip was FRA-HEL- MP (15th and 23rd September) and return (19th and 25th September). Both times departure from FRA was delayed on the 23rd the departure gate was announced only a few minutes before boarding was supposed to start. The stopover time in HEL is only one hour and since my flight was not the only one that was late the connecting flight to TMP was also delayed. Both times. On the trip back on the 23rd I had no checked luggage - luckily. Seemed like the computers were down I had a mobile boarding pass but everyone had to be checked manually from a printed list free seating on the first leg of the flight - no announcement from the crew as to what was going on the guy sitting next to me asked about his connecting flight (we were about 30 minutes delayed) and was simply told he has to pick up and re-check his luggage in Helsinki then miss the flight or catch the flight and then try to find his luggage later on - lots of other people had similar issues but all that was said via the speaker system was that everyone has to pick up and re-check their luggage in Helsinki nothing else. Absolutely no customer service connecting flights wouldn't wait if you wanted to catch the flight you would have to leave your luggage. The same then happened in Helsinki as well nobody showed up at the gate to start the boarding process until about 40 minutes past the scheduled departure time. The lady had a printout and checked every name manually from that list. At least the assigned seats from prior online-check-in were still valid this time. On the first trip I had luggage checked and both in TMP as well as in FRA it took forever to get it from the belt. In Tampere the distance from the plane to the belt is maybe 30 meters. You'd think it would be manageable to unload the luggage in less time than 30 minutes (plane on that route is an ATR propeller-plane very small). In Frankfurt I understand that it takes longer but I have had plenty of Lufthansa flights with apron- positions and even on those the luggage was on the belt after about 20 minutes. Finnair needed about 45 minutes for that. Another thing is that the desk service in Frankfurt is really terrible. The staff that handles the baggage drop is the same that handles the boarding - very unfriendly and sometimes even ignoring questions. Last but not least - the food is horrid. Some dry sandwich or bun with veggies on them. Either a hot drink or a cold drink. Now I read they want to get rid of free snacks on the European routes altogether. Anyway I will not fly Finnair again not voluntarily anyhow. Lucky that I book my own business trips and that Lufthansa / SAS has excellent service on the route to Tampere.,0,"I had to use Finnair twice in 2 weeks because I was not available on normally used Lufthansa / SAS flights.

However, flying out of LAX I looked at every other scheduled departures for Spirit and all of them were delayed by at least 2hours.

But when I flew out of LAX, I looked at all the other scheduled departures for Spirit and all were delayed by at least 2 hours. I really think people only complain when things go wrong - I thought maybe the bad reviews are so bad because those who get to where they want to go without a hiccup never bother to write reviews. In this sense, I had the whole intention of writing a review, no matter how good or bad the flight went. My flight was good, but the fact that all the other flights were so late scares me. I have heard some of her announcements about further delays and no explanation has been given. I won't fly Spirit anymore, just for this reason. They know that something is wrong when an airline can scare a passenger away for reasons that do not affect their own flight."
1017,Travelling back from Bangkok on 23rd Feb our flight was scheduled to land in Dubai Airport at 00.30 local time.

1023,"I was disappointed by my travel day with Air Canada from Vancouver to Toronto connecting in Toronto to Dublin. The first leg was delayed by an unknown amount because of maintenance issues. They bumped me and other passengers to a different plane so that we would make our connections (after delaying for about 1 hour and 45 minutes), which was appreciated but I ended up in a terrible seat and still cutting it extremely close and I have no idea when the original plane actually ended up taking off.

Seats very narrow on Boeing 777 and less comfortable than seats on British Airways EVA and Thai Airways which I have used on flights to Bangkok previously. IFE was OK. Food outbound to BKK was good with good wine and cheese. On the return journey back from Bangkok the food was poor with some type of very fatty meat as a main course that I (and my wife) could not eat or even identify. Furthermore after the main meal it was a long long time until breakfast was served leaving myself and my fellow passengers hungry. I later established that snacks were available if you made your own way to the galley to collect them but this availability was not announced and by the time I realised (whilst visiting the toilet) all of the sandwiches and most of the ice creams had gone (NOT acceptable). Cabin crew were pleasant and polite but did not seem proactive in any way and (to me) this was evidenced by the fact that they did not bother to serve the snacks or make any announcement as to their availability. The interconnection at CDG was pretty seamless and posed no problem at all.

Lufthansa has always been our preferred carrier but the new seating in economy was on the verge of intolerable. The way the seat attaches to the floor greatly limits what you can carry on there is no foot room. Knee room to the next row is minimal especially if the person in the seat in front leans back.

1059,"This was my first experience with Rouge. My biggest concern and the main reason for the low rating is the training and comportment of the cabin crew. They were all young and obviously inexperienced. The boarding through two doors was completely bungled chaotic because proper procedures were not followed.

I was left with a very distinct feeling that in case of emergency this crew would be no help at all in evacuation or other procedures. I have never felt that way on a commercial flight before. The Rouge design seems to be on the ""hipster"" model with banter such as ""you will get busted!"" referring to smoke detectors in the washrooms. Fair enough I guess flights do not have to be sombre to be safe I know from experience. But this needs to be better delivered in the Rouge case. There needs to be an adjustment of crew conduct related a better show of competence. The presence of a more mature (but cheerful!) crew manger would be a big help.

1064,Despite having 6 seats booked in business class including a black card holder (and two 80 year olds I might add) our 5.30pm flight was cancelled and we were moved to a 10.30pm one without so much as an email text or phone call. The VN airlines representative was most unaccommodating and the service was absolutely unacceptable. After numerous phone calls we were able to arrange 6 economy class seats on a 7.45pm flight: with just a 30 usd refund per ticket. Essentially we were made to pay excess baggage for our business class baggage allowance following this downgrade.

1068,LBA-AMS-SFO/IAD-AMS-LBA. Flew with KLM as part of our honeymoon in the USA. Both Cityhopper flights were excellent – no hassle quick decent snack and good attendants. Transfer going out was a bit tight but comfortable with a brisk walk and knowing your way through Schiphol.

1075,Vancouver to Frankfurt return. The flights themselves were probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. The food was good and the service was friendly. The seats don't allow much leg room and they seem a bit narrow but we managed. The real problem is with the Condor staff that check you in and I would give them a 1 out of 10.

Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25).

1090,"Chicago to Warsaw was delayed for more than 1hour however this delay is nothing compared to what happened next on my flight from Poznan to Krakow connecting at Warsaw. First they held us at the Poznan airport for more than 2 hours without a clear explanation. Flight was then cancelled and there were no more flights to Warsaw at that day.

After we arrived at Warsaw airport at about 4.30 am we asked about our connecting flight to Krakow and they told us there is no flight available today for us.

I purchased a one way ticket from Frankfurt to Moscow on a direct flight for a full price two days prior to departure. Upon arriving to the airport I noticed a small sign stating that the flight will be flown to Moscow via Kiev. When I inquired with the airline official about this change of route I was informed that the administration of the airline decided to change the route a few hours ago due to the inclement weather somewhere (didn't give me many details). Once we boarded the plane we were told that we had to wait for the cargo to be loaded. we ended up sitting on the plane for 2.5 hours prior to taking off. The flight crew couldn't provide any explanation for why we had to land in Kiev. At that point the version of inclement weather was abandoned. So we land in Kiev about five hours after our scheduled departure from Frankfurt - there we find out that the real reason for our landing in Kiev was a request by some either Russian or Ukrainian authority to pick up a cargo in Kiev and deliver it to Moscow. Loading of cargo and paperwork took another 2 hours during which the passenger had to stay on the plane and wonder what was going on. We did arrive to Moscow the next day at around 1 am (instead of scheduled 8:05pm). there were multiple passenger who missed their connection - some to destinations where flights only go a couple of times a week!

1126,"We were excited to hear that Air Canada was adding routes to Europe way back when we started booking a big family vacation this allowed us to fly into Venice and out of Rome on AC flights both ways. At the time Rouge had just started its international service so we didn't know what to expect but it's Air Canada right? It has to be at least decent. I have to say at this point thank goodness we changed our return flight date which meant we went from a Rouge flight to a regular AC flight. Travelling over 8 hours to Italy in those cramped circa 1970s metal framed seats was not fun and I had the luxury of a 4 year old next to me so I could use some of her space. I am not a tall person and I felt like my knees were in my armpits the entire time because of the ridiculously small seat pitch you can't actually recline your seat more than an inch maybe two inches.

I'm curious to know how there is still no Android app for their stupid in-flight entertainment system but I digress. People also need to know that the reviews here are accurate regarding the overhead bins they are not regular carry-on size each bin could fit maybe 1 item - for 4 seats! I would also like to point out that flying Rouge is definitely a buyer beware activity. I'm not sure if there are any cases of the prices reflecting the ""bargain airline"" thing they are trying to be but I think it is all kinds of insanity to charge the same for this service as for regular Air Canada flights. I know this is true because AC had a schedule change that meant we went from a regular flight to a Rouge flight and the gentleman at the call centre warned me that we would be getting less service for the same money. In fact he was required to explain that to me and I had to agree and it was made clear that this would be recorded so that there would be no ""misunderstandings."" As a result I got so nervous I changed that flight to a different day to avoid having to fly Rouge home and thank goodness for that. Two of our party were in business class on Rouge that meant Premium Rouge or some such silliness and they had slightly bigger seat space and a curtain to divide them from the steerage behind on Air Canada they had pods with lie flat beds for the same price. I'm sad to say that this is no exaggeration. Now if I pay a little bit of money for a discount flight on a bargain airline okay I expect to get what I paid for - not much.

It took us forever to reach the altitude needed to cross the mountains, and on landing we were greeted with the sight of what appeared to be burnt-out wreckage of other planes - I thought of going back to Dushanbe! Never again, but what an incredible experience."
1134,Hands down the worst airline I've ever flown on.

1151,Flew from Madrid (MAD) to Santiago de Chile (SCL) with this airline on May 19th 2014 and was highly disappointed by catering options and on-board entertainment and service. Aircraft: Iberia operates the A340-600 with the old color scheme for this route. Flight Duration: 14hr (due to strong headwinds). Return Flight: same aircraft. Class: Economy. Price: GBP 614 for a return flight from FRA with a 2hr stop in MAD. Inflight entertainment: The were no personal monitors. We were sitting quite far from the big screen at the front row. This made watching the 3 movies shown during the flight difficult. Besides there was a lot of image noise and the screen was flattering occasionally. You could really see a grey noise stripe moving from one end of the screen to another all the time. Food and Beverages: Since we left MAD past midnight Iberia thinks it can skip a meal as it expects the passengers to sleep (what else do you want to do on a 14hr flight without any kind of on-board entertainment). Dinner was served 1hr after departure. Whisky or any other liquor (except beer and wine) was not on the trolley. I was told to kindly wait but nothing happened. We were served breakfast consisting of a dry ham sandwich (white bun no lettuce and butter tasted horrible) ca. 1.5h before arrival in SCL. No meals were served in-between which means 10+ hours without food. We got served a small salami sandwich on the way back as a snack though. But in comparison to what I have experienced flying e.g. Asiana Qantas Lufthansa or even US Airways (not my first choice though) this is absolutely unacceptable. Staff service: You had to go to the kitchen to get a glass of water as no drinks were served in-between too. Not sure what the flights attendants were doing between meals but I haven's seen them offering any refreshments or taking care of the 350+ guests between the meals. Seat comfort: Seats were comfortable and I felt I had more legroom (I am 6.3 190cm) than e.g. on an intercontinental US Airways Delta or Qantas flight. Overall: (7/10).

1163,Thomas Cook are not a family friendly airline. Following booking for a long haul flight we contacted Thomas Cook to request a bassinet for an infant however apparently Thomas Cook do not offer this service but we were not made aware of this at the time of booking. The only alternative is to pay for a full price seat and to bring your own car seat however if you do this no infant baggage allowance is given so you can add on an extra £200 for baggage alone. What a complete rip off. Bassinets are offered by other airlines which is who we will travel with in future as it's too late to do anything about it now. I will certainly never book flights with Thomas Cook again. What an appalling way to treat families travelling. Since we can't afford to pay another full price fare as well as the extra baggage fee on top of the existing holiday cost our poor little man will have to sit on our knees for the whole lengthy flight without the option of lying him down in a bassinet where he would be able to get some sleep and I'm sure is would also have been beneficial to other travellers on the flight.

1182,"LHR to LAX return: We flew economy and having flown with them to India earlier this year we decided not to expect much. The flight outwards (June) was a little delayed because the Captain was stuck on the M25 in a traffic jam but we arrived in LAX only a few minutes late. The flight back (September) left on time and arrived early. Both planes were reasonably new and the entertainment systems worked once they had been rebooted.

They did give everyone the impression that the trip was a holiday for them and they were going to have a good time when they got to LAX (or LHR) and were very self congratulatory over the PA system on ""how hard they had worked to please us"". Maybe they think that if they say it often enough we will believe them.

The outbound flight (June) was delayed a little because the captain was stuck in a traffic jam on the M25, but we arrived at LAX a few minutes late. The return flight (September) was on time and arrived early. Both planes were relatively new and the entertainment systems worked after take-off. The check-in staff were helpful and took our ""just over the weight limit bags"" without comment. The food on both legs was very bad and after enduring their awful versions of vegetarian food when we travelled to India, I had bought my own main course from M & S (LHR) or a deli (LAX) as a precaution - which turned out to be a wise decision and I was envied by my colleagues. On the return flight, drinks arrived after the meal, which seemed a bit strange to us. Breakfast in the business world was a complete joke and not worth talking about. The cabin crew worked pretty hard but I got a little tired of the cabin announcements.

1184,I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 8 years and up to 2 years ago I had no real problems and planes were never delayed more than 5 or 10 mins. However in the last 2 years I have increasingly experienced delays which coupled with the ludicrous different terminal and concourse situation at Dubai has led to problems in transfers at DXB. My last two trips LGW-DXB-Bkk involved 4 sector flights each and in those trips only one flight was on time. Last night I flew DXB to LGW on a A380 (500 passengers) arriving at the boarding gate 45 mins before departure I saw that boarding had started and majority of economy passengers had boarded. I was told there was a delay so better to wait in the business lounge. Only one announcement was made. No further announcements or information given. 70 mins later a large Indian tour party (40 persons) arrived at the gate and immediately a final call for boarding was issued and the flight took off. Clearly the flight of 500 persons was delayed to satisfy the tour party. Talking to fellow passengers at DXB on the plane and at LGW it seems the reliability is slipping. The service on board is hit and miss and in fact last night's service DXB-LGW and the LGW ground support was the worst I have experienced.,0,"I have flown regularly with Emirates for 8 years and until 2 years ago I had no real problems and the planes were never more than 5 or 10 minutes late.

1217,I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for.

We are on our way from Toronto to Cancun on Air Transat Flight # 520, which should have taken off at 8: 25 a.m. They boarded most of us just to tell us that the plane needs repairing and we need to leave the plane. In about half an hour we are told that the plane will be repaired and the new departure will be at 1.50pm. At around 11 a.m. we find out that the plane is stationary and will be at the gate in a few minutes. Everyone was very happy, but the happiness was over when we found out the team was gone.

1227,When our daughter decided to get married in Las Vegas my husband and I were not able to find a return flight on the necessary day so we decided to split our flights and we took a competitor's airline going to Vegas and Allegiant coming home to Billings Montana. The flight to Vegas was a dream I wish I could say the same for the flight coming home on Allegiant. First we are charged $10 for our boarding passes even though I told the lady that I had them on my phone. Then she told us our flight had been moved up an hour so we ran through the airport made it through security and up to the boarding area only to be told that our flight time had not changed. Then we get on the plane and are told that there are snacks available but only if you pay for them and that includes water and ice. I could not believe that after paying $300 for our tickets we couldn't even get a bottle of water for free. Throughout the 90 minute trip the flight attendants only came out of their little cubby hole when they were doing the safety check and to go down the aisle to see if anyone wanted to buy anything. They were rude and spent the entire flight talking to each other about personal happenings. I thought that I would save a few dollars by taking Allegiant but in the end it ended up costing me more than any of the other airlines. I can honestly say that I would rather pay a little more to be able to get a drink of water if I need one and to have someone friendly and happy to see me come on board.,0,"When our daughter decided to get married in Las Vegas, my husband and I couldn't find a return flight the next day, so we decided to split our flights and took a competitor's airline that flew to Vegas and Allegiant that returned to Billings Montana.

1254,Dec 2013 flight between Bangkok and Hambantota was cancelled with only 3 days notice from Sri Lankan Airlines. All future flights between these cities also cancelled. No explanation given. My family were re-booked onto a flight between Bangkok and Colombo 15 hours after the intended departure time requiring an overnight stay in Colombo and then a 5.5 hour car drive the following morning to get my family to our Pre-booked accommodation in the South East of Sri Lanka near Yala. We had 3 other flights pre-booked with Sri Lankan Airlines as part of our holiday (which was partly ruined by our forced itinerary changes). In summary our flight experience was as follows: Food and beverage seemed slightly better than many other airlines we've travelled with. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and professional. In-flight entertainment may as well have been non-existent. I don't recall it being that bad 30 years ago. The age of the plane it's seats screens and entertainment consoles must be approximately 30 years old.

1255,I will never fly with Spirit Airlines again. This airline charges far too much. I had to pay $150 extra dollars just to check a bag and bring a carry-on round-trip and pay $10 for my seats each way!

1288,I booked an Alaska flight for a short trip to San Jose CA from Los Angeles. I have never had an experience like the one I did on the return trip. 10 mins into the flight the cabin told us that due to a high volume of air traffic we would likely be delayed about 15-20 mins and would have to circle over LAX while waiting for a runway to open up. We end up circling over LAX for about 30 mins which wouldn't have been a big deal either except that we didn't land at LAX we landed at Long Beach about 30 mins away by car or 1hr 30mins with LA traffic). Then sat on the tarmac at Long Beach for nearly 2 hrs this is a 1 hr and 20 min flight to begin with and was given no information whatsoever about the airline's plans for us. When certain passengers were permitted to debark they were informed that they would be unable to retrieve their baggage from under the plane and would only be allowed to take their carryon out. Most of us had figured that the airline would probably shuttle us over to LAX. Word comes over the loudspeaker that we're flying back to LAX and will be there in about 1hr. I was expecting to meet an Alaska Airlines representative to explain to us that we would all get vouchers for cabs missed flights etc. no such luck. Not only did no one make an effort no one was even around. I couldn't find anyone from the airline other than the uninformed pilot and stewardesses.

1289,Flew Zurich-Heathrow-Boston on Feb 28 worst flight of my life.

1292,I have been a passenger with numerous airlines since 1957 and in recent years frequently from Alicante to several different British airports. Ryanair is one of the worst I've ever travelled with and definitely the worst on this route. On the outward Alicante/East Midlands Airport journey we sat on the runway for almost an hour because they had missed their slot. This made for a long and tedious journey. This however was nowhere near as bad as the return flight. We left plenty of time to return the hire car and arrive at the airport in time to have a leisurely lunch (as we always do at Gatwick) as we knew that it would be late when we arrived home only to discover that we could not enter the departure lounge until 2 hours before our flight was due to leave. This would have been okay if there had been somewhere for two elderly passengers to sit (all chairs were taken and we were left standing with all our luggage) or somewhere to have a decent meal (there is one very unappetising place with food served in cardboard). Also two hours would have been sufficient time if it hadn't taken more than an hour to wind our way through the queue to the check in desk. When we arrived at the desk we were told that our case was too heavy (1kg overweight) most airlines will waive this fractional overweight but the representative told us that we had only paid for 15kg and would have to put the excess in our hand baggage. This we did in full view of the other passengers and consisted of 2 tee-shirts and a pair of light shoes. Whilst we were waiting to board the aircraft the attendant asked us if we would like to put our hand baggage in the hold free of charge! My logic and fairly basic grasp of maths cannot make sense of this! I had been warned not to travel Ryanair and I never will again.,0,"I have been a passenger on numerous airlines since 1957 and have frequently flown from Alicante to various British airports in recent years.

I am just under 6ft tall and weigh normal, but I could not sit in any position without my knees being crushed from the seat in front of me. Shortly after the start, the man leaned back in front of me (lying down is very restricted), but that made any further movement impossible. The person in front of me claimed he did not understand English, the stewardess tried to persuade him to move his chair upright, but he refused. Flight attendant told me it was his right to sit back. Fortunately, it was just over an hour's flight. The flight attendants were friendly, serving a soft drink and sweet or savoury snacks. The disembarkation was chaotic again, the first bus left the tarmac half empty, the second and last bus was crowded and felt suffocated, stood in the hot midday sun and the doors were closed for too long.

I flew Cambodian last year from BKK to REP and found them an excellent airline that being said this September when I flew SGN to REP I was quite disappointed. The flight was delayed without notification which is ok but not ideal. The problem was the aircraft. It was a very old A321 leased from Vietnam Airlines and the interior was sparse to say the least. My exit row seat was broken. The button to shift the seat back was actually detached from the armrest and was hanging down by a couple of wires near the ground. The TV's for the safety video were the style that lowered from the ceiling and then went back into place as the flight departed. The only problem was that they didn't work and the safety video was audio with no visual. Ok so its an old plane still no problems.

1325,"This concerns Air Canada's Business Class Service on its international flights. Air Canada has introduced its new seat configurations on its 777 aircrafts. It is a marked change from the ""pods"" that it uses on its 767s. Regrettably the new configurations are horrible. My complaints are not so much about having to sit side by side someone in the rows but rather its the amenities and the way in which the seats work altogether. The flat bed seats are most uncomfortable. The seats do not accommodate one from moving their feet because once the bed is flat your feet go into an area that does not allow for any movement. You must physically remove one foot at a time to adjust your resting position. Headphones in business class are awful. They provide ear bud style head sets but they are cheap and sound quality is awful. You can request an over the ear headphone which they have on board but do not offer unless asked. Sound quality is better but when they deliver the units to you there are sponge coverings that must be affixed over each ear speaker. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge coverings do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge has a tendency to rip! The controls for the seats are located in two locations - one on the table that is used to rest your arms. This of course means unintentional adjustments are made to your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls. The second set of controls are not easy to find at first and are only usable when the seat is in a flat bed mode. I also had difficulty having the bed go into a flat bed mode. The seats seam to get jammed on settings that would not allow the bed to fully extend and it took some time and multiple pressing of buttons to convince the seat to fully extend. Last beef concerns the tray table. Whoever designed this table should be shot! At first the table seems reasonable: press a release button and pop goes the table. Fold it out and you are in business. Now the tricky part - putting the table away. Folding is ok but then you have to align three very faintly marked arrows and then figure out a way to force the table back into its locked position. I couldn't do it and required assistance each and every time. It was interesting to hear from the flight crew that there have been many many complaints about these new seats. Air Canada however is not taking any steps to address these concerns which is too bad. The crew mentioned that the seating was an after thought and that they were not asked for any advice or input on the selection of the consoles. Too bad. I will be going out of my way not to use Air Canada because of this uncomfortable experience. Other airlines like Cathay and Singapore have far better seats and amenities.

They offer earphone-style headphones, but they are cheap and the sound quality is terrible. You can request a headset via the ear that you have on board, but only on request. Sound quality is better, but if they provide you with the devices, there are sponge covers that must be placed over each earphone. This task is incredibly difficult! The sponge pads do not fit well over the oval speakers and the sponge tends to tear! The controls for the seats are located in two places - one on the table, on which the arms rest. This means, of course, that you unintentionally adjust your seat settings when your arms rest on the controls."
1326,"As a top tier AC frequent flyer I checked in using the priority lane. The agent was aloof. We had an onward connection with Lufthansa and despite providing her with booking reference and ticket numbers, she insisted there was nothing she could do to issue our boarding passes, so much for seamless integration with Star Alliance. On board, it was a very tired looking A330. The FA's bordered on rude and threw drinks and meal trays at the passengers. The food in both quality and quantity were on par with a budget airline. Seats were OK for economy and IFE had decent selection. AC lost its title as Best North American carrier and I hope this serves as a warning to them as their service and especially staff interactions have put them on par with the rest of the mainstream carriers in North America.

1327,My wife and I booked a flight on the Edelweiss flight direct from Tampa to/from Zurich with Swiss. We chose to use Swiss primarily because they are a Star Alliance member and I am a Gold Premier member. We were assigned poor seats didn't get priority boarding or any of the other perks that are supposed to come with Gold Premier status. When I contacted Swiss about this I was advised all the information we relied on in choosing Swiss was incorrect. So even though we paid Swiss which issued the tickets and the plane was referenced as a Swiss flight there were no Star Alliance benefits and I would not receive any miles. As to the Swiss affiliate Edelweiss the plane was hot cramped uncomfortable and all drinks were a charge for this 10-hour flight. This was on the way to and from. To add insult to injury the staff were cold and short even for people from Central Europe and Edelweiss will allow the Economy Plus (Extra) to go empty rather than upgrade anyone with Star Alliance status. Instead they want $200 per person per way. The Economy Plus on our return flight was empty yet they ran out of food (unless you want curry on a 10-hour flight) and we were only 3 rows back from the front of Economy. In short we will never fly Swiss or Edelweiss again. Better bet out of Tampa is to drive to Orlando and take the direct on Lufthansa to Frankfurt.,0,"My wife and I booked a flight on the Edelweiss flight directly from Tampa to / from Zurich with Swiss.

Cons - The seats are not so comfortable firm dirty as if the covers have not been cleaned or washed in a long time. The crew members are not of the standard to be aboard an international flight. They just lack service quality compared to the likes of Emirates or Qatar. Very unprofessional. They only show up during refreshment services. Care less to see if any passengers would need assistance with anything else through out the flight. They don't clean the rest rooms or feel the need to fill in tissues once these runs out.

Shortly after my election, I tried to choose a seat as far in front as possible, but was asked to pay 35 euros for a row seat. 27th 35 euros and you are almost at the end of the plane. In the end, BA was more expensive than others. The flight was ok and punctual B777 not really my choice as a very noisy staff service - one hostess was excellent, another was ignorant and unwilling. Eat the usual penne rigate. BA complained by email but never received a reply. On my return flight, I sat in row 30, the same noisy B777, the same Penne Rigate and, of course, a good choice of in-flight entertainment. Breakfast with nice frozen rolls. Yes, frozen or chilled.

1380,This past week I flew with Spirit Airlines for the first and last time.

It took every bit of my patience to not ask if she was blind. This is a very unwelcome airline. There is absolutely nothing complimentary on this airline.

1388,EZY5336 17th July 2014. On the plus side Easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. Firstly the baggage drop at Gatwick is woeful. You really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because EZ can't be bothered to have all the desks open (or rent some more). Staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. Perhaps it's better not to arrive too early and just wait for the 'late shout' - it's probably quicker! It's not as if EZ don't know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. The 2nd irritation is being called to 'board' when at the gate. This isn't really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen (eg Toulouse) and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. Again it's for Easyjet's convenience/saving not the customers'. Why call family groups first so > they can stand for longer rather than call them last? Sometimes Easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. For me I'd pay a small premium for a decent airline. But if you don't mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board they're OK. Better than Ryanair though.,0,"EZY5336 July 17, 2014.

1400,Recently flew Birmingham to Hurghada. When checking in I asked if we could sit as close to the front of the plane as possible and was allocated row 10. Legroom was ok but seats were of the old variety. I thought Monarch were retrofitting their seats so it was disappointing to get the old armchair seats. Service Onboard was great. Check in at Hurghada was a different story. I again asked if we could be sat quite close to the front but was told that we had to pay for extra legroom seats. Speaking to one check in agent he said it was £30 per seat but as 5 people were travelling he would do us a deal of 3 seats for the price of 5. I doubt this was company procedure and the monies would have made their way into the check in agents pockets. Appreciate Monarch can't vouch for all those working in behalf of the company but they need to be aware that others are trying to profit from their usual jobs as we have been seated in what are the extra legroom seats on return flights free of charge previously.

1402,Flew Maxjet to Los Angeles and back from Las Vegas have to say the experience was disappointing feel MaxJet jet offers economy class service with old fashioned business class seats. The cabin crew were the worst I have experienced. The digiplayer means you cannot use your tray for meals or work and watch the TV. No pre take -off drink first proper drink offered one hour after take-off meal took forever which on a night flight to wait two hours for the meal to be served is stupid we took off at 19.30 by 22.00 we were still only being offered the dessert. Breakfast was the same slow service and slow to take away the trays which made many of the passengers impatient. Shame as the quality of the food is very good. The basic problem is lack of interest by the cabin crew who seem to respond to people asking for what they want rather that actually knowing what people want. The cabin steward serving our side of the plane went down the isle serving one drink at a time - I had a glass of red my wife had glass of white he went to the front came back with my wife's white wine went back and came back with my red!

1409,We are a Star Alliance Gold family. We purchased Economy tickets from NRT-IAH-FLL-SCE-IAD-NRT but I later upgraded to BusinessFirst with cash. The cash upgrade cost $1400 each. On the NRT-IAH leg the first thing that I found odd was that the FA literally threw the tablecloth to/at me at the beginning of dinner service. I think he just didn't care because throughout the flight his demeanor was cold. Small things like my wife's request for water without ice were met with the glass of water with the biggest piece of ice in it. The seat was great the food was about what you'd expect at a family restaurant and I'm ok with both of these things but I really had to wonder don't people who pay to fly premium deserve at least not passive-aggressive”service? I guess not. The NRT- IAH departure was an hour late due to weather. We were not able to make our connection at IAH. I bet United Airlines could have helped expedite passengers (through immigration/customs/re-checking) with tight connections. Our IAH-FLL departed while we were waiting for our bags. I informed the UA rep at the baggage claim and he told me they'd rebooked us on the next mornings 06.40 IAH-FLL. I asked if I could get a meal/hotel voucher but he informed me that since it was a weather delay UA couldn't take care of us. We feared that we might oversleep the 06.40 flight because of the jetlag. I called UA to ask for another booking and though there were 4 IAH-FLL flights that day our only options were 06.40 or 20.00 departure. Their website revealed open seats on all flights but the rep explained to me that those were first class seats and we weren't eligible for them. The weather delay on departure was caused by a typhoon. IAH is also known to be quite poor at handling international flights. UA made the decision to sell NRT-IAH tickets with a 1.5-hour buffer nonetheless. Maybe it's my fault for buying it but at any rate rather than stay up all night or lose yet another day with my family we accepted a better-timed flight to MIA. Our business with UA resumed two weeks later for the SCE-IAD-NRT return to Japan we took another carrier for our FLL-MBJ and MBJ-ATL-DTW-SCE trips. I mistakenly placed a bottle of honey in my carry-on which was picked up by TSA at security. I figured that if I couldn't get to my bags I could box and check it. I saw my bags were already gone so I waited at the side of the check-in line and figured I would wait until they announced last call for SCE-IAD. The desk rep soon did so and I politely explained “I'd like to get this in to my checked bags.” The man was the portrait of hypertension and stress. He acted as if the world were about to end. Eventually another rep nicely asked me to go get a box from the store across the hallway and I did and when I came back the stressed-out rep acquiesced and while printing the tape/tags repeated over and over “ The flights boarding/you've got to get on it/it’s leaving.”The flight was just starting to board.

1423,Flew Prague to Luton with Wizz Air for the first time and unfortunately fell victim to large cabin baggage and therefore had to pay £60 to board with our luggage - which incidentally is small enough with respect to other non- frill flights with EasyJet and RyanAir.

Flights with a stop over are considered direct by this airline but you have to get off the plane. That becomes a real hassle if you coming back into the US and have to go through immigration and border control. The airline does not allow enough time for this! Study their website in every detail and do your math before you book you will end up being better off initially paying more with other airlines. There is a boarding check-in charge of $10 per person each way if not done on the internet which is hard to do for your return trip since you need to print your boarding pass. This can only be done 24 hrs or less and more that 1hr before departure. The planes are new but seats and tables are filthy.

Surprised though that the bar was closed all through the flight. Toilets on the A330 were few in number (one dedicated and two shared with Premium Economy) and because there is no centre luggage bin the scrabble for overhead bin space on this full flight was ridiculous.

1467,TOM144 Manchester to Cancun. 787 Dreamliner Premium Club Cabin. An impressive modern new aircraft with great mood lighting which created a more relaxed atmosphere. The crew were friendly overall and the food was pretty good. The one thing that let Thomson down was the seat. For an aircraft that was 10 years in the planning it I think someone has messed up at Thomson with a basic design consideration. The seat itself is relatively comfortable and once sat down the leg room is adequate. This issue is that seat in the Premium cabin is clearly not designed to be so close to the seat in front. The TV screens are stowed in the central arm of the seat meaning that the arm rests between the seats protrudes out a significant distance to the seat in front. Even with the seats in the upright position the average sized person struggles to get out of the window seat without climbing over the aisle seat. During the flight you are regularly disturbed by the person behind grabbing your seat back in order for them to try and manoeuvre out of their window seat. You can already see signs of damage on the aisle seat armrest where the person in the window seat has put their weight on the armrest in order to get them self out. The seats recline no more than an inch or so and I assume they have been restricted as an afterthought in order to try and minimise the issue. This is annoying as it would be nice to recline your seat a little to get some rest (there will not be much dreaming going on in the Thomson Dreamliner). Once the seat in front reclines even this short distance you effectively become trapped in the window seat. The seats power sockets and headphone sockets are also located in the front of the central armrest holding the tv screens. It is almost impossible to access the sockets because you can't see the sockets or move your head into a position where you can. This is because your head hits the seat in front before you can get a viewing angle to see the sockets. Not looking forward to my long night flight home as I had hoped I would sleep.

My partner and I couldn't get seats together when I booked extra legroom for both of us, so we had aisle seats, but the two seats in front of my partner were empty and it would have been nice if the attendants had offered us the seats so we could sit together. I must say that our flight home was much better and the flight attendants were consistently friendly, helpful and professional. Our flight on August 25, 8132 at 2.10pm was horrendous."

1473,I fly every week and the Spirit flight times are convenient. I got claustrophobic in the tiny seats so I tried to upgrade to an aisle seat. The website messed up and first charged me for two seat upgrades then stuck me in the back window seat anyway. On the return trip it showed me seated in a big front seat. Then when I printed off the boarding pass I was stuck in a back window seat again! I went to the gate and was told there was nothing they could do on the (already delayed) flight. I tried calling customer service and going on the website but could not get through to customer service at all. Is this how they treat their frequent flyers?

Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag.

But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left.

Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate.

1480,HKG-DXB-VIE and the same in return using A340 B777 and A380 aircraft. Three out of four sectors were fine: Excellent service and very clean and quiet aircraft. Big disappointment was in Business Class on the A380 due to one main factor: the fact that there is a fully serviced lounge bar area at the rear of Business Class. This sounds rather special until we realised that loud mouthed yobbos can stay in there for the entire journey (in this case Dubai to Hong Kong) and walking up and down the aisles with their drinks and abusing staff for not being fed lunch on time (even though they were all in the bar) and so on. I had to move further to the front of the aircraft to avoid the noise coming from this bar lounge area. This made for a very unpleasant experience and I could understand why some staff were very sad and quiet in going about their duties. Perhaps Emirates should seriously consider getting rid of this little so-called luxury as the concept seems to have backfired badly.

1481,Business class to Singapore from LAX. My recommendation is to select even number rows to avoid being disturbed by people passing by. The seats are poorly designed and obvious wasted space for reading materials should have been used for added comfort for the passenger. The extra pillow can be used to soften the side area and asking for an extra blanket can add softness to the hard seat. The video selection is limited and food selection is poor. The stewardess did not appear to have a working system and my partner received her food much later than us.

1494,We flew business class on QF3 SYD-HNL as part of a round the world ticket. The cabin was in no way a business class cabin. The seats were reclining armchairs which is fine if there is plenty of room between rows but there was not. The consequence of this was that when the lady in front of my husband decided not to eat dinner but recline her seat to its fullest extent he had her head in his lap whilst trying to eat dinner. It was impossible to gain access to the aisle from a window seat without physically clambering over the person seated next to you not good if the person seated next to you is a complete stranger. When I enquired about the entertainment system I was told that there was an iPad in the seat back pocket I thought it was a joke. The iPad was streaming films etc but had to be held or propped up on the tray table impossible to watch and eat at the same time. The ear phone jack plug did not fit properly with constant loss of picture and sound every time you moved. Totally unacceptable in business class. It would seem that Qantas have no competition on this route and are therefore able to get away with offering this extremely substandard cabin to its business class customers.,0,"We flew business class on QF3 SYD-HNL as part of a round-the-world ticket.

Breakfast was a weird mixed grill wrap? which was luke warm managed to hang onto digiplayer until 40 mins from landing much to the annoyance of cabin crew.

The agents at the check in apologized and offered a $5/person voucher - enough to buy a coffee! On our flight back home same issue the flight back was delayed almost 2 hours because again the crew was late. This time we had to ask the Sunwing agents for a voucher but they said sorry this is Mexico we do not offer vouchers. On top of everything else the seats were most uncomfortable mine didn't even recline back and there was no way to change seats because the plane was full.

When checking in at Calgary airport we were the very first people in line at the counter their agent assigned us seats in the row behind our friends. Once we got to the gate an agent paged us to the counter and informed us that our seats had been sold (I assume online) and should not have been assigned to us.

1499,Southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience I ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering I am on a flight 3-4 days a week. This was on Flight 110 from FLL to BNA on May 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. However 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. I have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 60-90 mins. This speaks about Southwest's abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. The flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 5-10 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill.

1504,The main problem flying economy class with Royal Brunei in my view is their Boeing Dreamliner aircraft I don't know who designed the seats in it's economy section but passenger comfort was clearly not a consideration. If you can sit on a park bench with your elbows pressed against your ribs for hours on end then this is the aircraft for you however I struggled. Leg room was actually not bad (I'm 6') but the seat width was very cramped with a reclining mechanism which just didn't work on my seat and others. A 2x4x2 seating configuration would have been far better than the 3x3x3 currently employed. Other in-flight irritations included toilets which could somehow display an 'engaged' red light when in fact they were empty leading to unnecessary queuing the inability to cut between aisles to visit an opposing toilet due to the tight seating layout and no seat hook to hang a jacket or jumper only an insecure communal locker somewhere forward.

1542,I flew on Condor from Frankfurt to Seattle. For an international flight the service was rather good. Meals were above average and there was more leg space than anticipated (but then I am a small person). However I was disappointed because this flight was delayed by 4 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. There was no transparency about the reasons for the delay. We were given no advance warnings even having signed up for mail alerts. Despite getting complimentary cocktails and unlimited access to the entertainment system the bottom line is that this flight was abnormally late (whereas all the other flights in the entire terminal were within 30 minutes of scheduled departure) and we were not updated at all on the situation.,0,"I flew with Condor from Frankfurt to Seattle.

1543,Mongolia to Singapore and then Air Asia to Koto Kinabalu in East Malaysia. Worst check in service I have ever experienced. Purchased advance seats in row 6 (A and C) from ULN to Singapore via PEK for Oct 25 2014. No record of them when we checked in but after much debate got seats 6D and E.

Same thing happening to another passenger. We asked for a supervisor but no one showed up.

1544,HTI - SYD - 2nd Jan 2014. Had a great time on Hamilton Island with the family. Arrived at the island airport to travel home and the check-in line went out the terminal down the ramp and into the car park. After about 35 minutes we made our way up the ramp and into the check-in area. One person to check-in 150 passengers. I did notice another Virgin staff member coming and going waving a radio around check a passenger or two and then disappear again. We had now been in line for 1.4 hours and it was apparent there was no way this plane was going to leave on time. 30 minutes before scheduled departure the staff member waving the radio around and another staff member arrived and the check in intensity increased. The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crèche. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight. We downloaded the app but alas the entertainment system on board was not working. Being in the 2nd back row the food cart eventually arrives and there is only a few crumbs left that that the other passengers didnt want. All the decent food had gone. Maybe they could start the service at the back of the plane and then move forward or carry enough of the good stuff for all. We were offered a complimentary noodle dish but it was too spicy for the kids. Once the food service was completed they started the rubbish collection I tried to hand over the rubbish to the flight attendant as they passed me but was told to hang onto the rubbish until they got to me later.

The meal service in Euro Traveller is appalling as are the customer service standards of the New Mixed Fleet Crew The food offering was inedible a choice of Flat Bread with Chicken Tikka or a Salad. Do British Airways not understand that not everyone likes Curry or spicy food. At least do an offering of Meat or Cheese Sandwiches to make the selection a little better in consideration of the fares passengers have paid. As for the cabin crew this new Mixed Fleet with their Thunderbird Hats are very inferior compared to the cabin crew on the old contracts. At least experienced cabin crew would sort something out in the galley to at least compensate for the lack of food choice even if it is cheese and crackers. This crew do not offer anything and were nowhere to be seen once they did their meal service. I would have expected for a two hour flight they would at least walk through the cabin a few times offering more drinks etc the only time they came out was to clear away the meals which many people around me had left and not touched and to do the Duty Free.

1549,Outward flight from LGW to FUE on a nearly new Boeing 737-800 in extra legroom seats (row 15). Seat pitch and width good crew efficient and worked hard.

The food service was acceptable and has not changed much (except for the smaller portion) from which I first flew with BA about 15 years ago.

This made the travel experience felt like cattle class as the seat dimension is typical economy seat size. All other airlines have improved the travel experience by improving the economy seat design. The worst experience was on the return leg when a passenger absolutely refused to put his seat upright during the dinner service and this was after I asked him repeatedly.

1554,Feb 20 2015 from Punta Gorda Fl. to South Bend IN. I have emphysema and spinal stenosis and need a wheelchair to get through security and to the plane. I can walk certain distances but not as far as through airports and to planes. My friends drove me to the airport but had to get a wheelchair for me because they had no one to do it for me. Then they did not have anyone to push me through security and to the gate so my friend had to get a pass to push me through all that. At the gate an older man with a cane came over beside me and there were some wheelchairs sitting there so he got one to sit in and asked me if I knew why there was no help for us. Usually handicapped people are boarded first along with people with children and first class passengers. This did not happen with Allegiant Air. They boarded a long line of what seemed to be a lot of first class passengers and I don't know who else before the actually asked the older gentlemen if we needed help to the plane. They finally pushed us to the plane. My assigned seat was in the second row so I don't know where the so-called first class people were sitting. The biggest insult came after landing in South Bend IN. They announced that people waiting for wheelchairs were to remain on the plane until all other passengers were gone. I was surprised to see several wheelchairs sitting just outside the plane door but no people to push them. Finally someone came and pushed me into the airport. Another point against Allegiant Air is when I tried to print my boarding pass it wouldn't let me. This is usually because I have to carry a POC (oxygen concentrator) to use on board. I printed the page telling me this because they charge $5.00 if your boarding pass has to be printed at the airport. Foolishly I thought since I showed them I couldn't print my boarding pass they wouldn't charge me $5.00 but they did without telling me. It just showed up on my credit card.

1564,"If I could give negative numbers I would. We attempted 3 times to check in online without success. Once we arrived to the airport and checked in there we were charged an extra 30 euro service fee for not checking in online. They did not seem to care that we had tried multiple times online with no success. Checking our bags was also more expensive because we paid at the airport instead of doing it online prior to arrival. By the time they were done with all of the extra fees, the total for the extra fees was close to what we had paid for our original ticket. They had our passports as we had given them to the agent in order to check us in, and we were told we could have them back once we paid the fees. I felt as if our passports were being held for ransom! To add to our experience the gate was changed without any notice or announcements. The only reason we found out about the gate change was because I approached the gate agent of the initial gate about why we had not started boarding and our flight was due to leave in 10 minutes. That was when she informed that our flight had changed gates and we should go there. Then our flight was delayed, thankfully for only 45 minutes or we would have missed our next connection.

I have experienced United airlines and Continental patrons are in for a very rough go of i. This complete disregard for upgrading Platinum members is just the beginning.

1573,I have flown Biman on the London-Dubai route many times. My belief is that service provided by Biman 20 or even 10 years ago was far superior to the service currently on offer.

The main problems with Biman are that it has failed to modernise it's old fleet (root of all delays) failed to introduce modern in-flight entertainment (seatback videos) failed to address unprofessional hostesses failed to deal with it's corrupt booking officials and above all failed to appreciate the loyal customers which have kept it flying.

It really hurts me to say this - a very bad way to present a country's airline."

1582,As a regular traveller throughout the Pacific for over 30 years I have found the Aircalin services especially good. The check in service is excellent and friendly the staff helpful for those who don't speak French. The menus are always a surprise with generous meals and drinks presented in immaculate style. Their new planes are first class in comparison with the Qantas 767 Sunday afternoon flight from Noumea to Sydney where old planes (200 series) and grumpy staff generally bring you back to earth with all of the finesse of a smack in the face.,0,"As a regular traveller in the Pacific for over 30 years, I find the Aircalin services particularly good.

1585,I bought the ticket as it was the cheapest available the service was horrible. The planes are ok and sometime you will have plenty of space to rest. There is very little in flight entertainment system. The headset does not work for most of the seats. Sana'a international airport is the worst airport I have seen in my life. There is a big dirty waiting room for the transit passenger and no facility to buy food or even shop. Strangely enough you have to request the guards to let you in the duty free region and most of them don’t understand English. The airport staff are very rough. The connecting flights are not regular. So if you miss one you are stuck at Sana'a for 2/3 days. Onboard food choice is very limited and sometimes I was offered no choice.

1586,I have been disappointed with this airline on many occasions especially the fact that somehow they seem to hate jetsteps and they seem to favour the good old diesel buses from plane to terminal. In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise. Most passengers strongly complained and threw them away. Aegean could be good if they decide to eliminate such problems and make use of modern facilities not the good old diesel bus.,0,"I've been disappointed with this airline many times, especially because it seems to hate jetstep flights somehow and seems to prefer the good old diesel buses from the plane to the terminal.

1590,My son and I flew Portugalia Airlines from Malaga to Lisbon June 2014. The leg was flown in a Beechcraft 1800D. We arrived in Lisbon without our luggage as did a half dozen other passengers. We were on a 43 day trip around the world and this was day 3. Not good. After 3 days our luggage arrived. My gripe is why did it take 3 days come to find out our luggage was never boarded in Malaga. I would guess this was due to weight restrictions as we saw them unload the baggage and there were only a few pieces. There was plenty of space left in the baggage compartment. The luggage could have been with us early the next morning. as there were several flights that could make this happen. I believe there was a neglect on the airlines side that they didn't get it to us sooner. Especially since we filed a loss luggage report at once. This would have made it a lot less stressful on us. We were about to go shopping or new clothes on day 3 of the ordeal when the 2 pieces arrived. I would fly Portugalia Airlines again but not in this type of aircraft.

1591,Flew from Heathrow to San Francisco on May 1st with BA. What a disappointment! I had to pay over £120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight. Then we couldn't access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem.

The design of the plane puts the obvious place to queue opposite the toilet doors but Thomson sell this space as extra leg room. You are asked to queue in the narrow aisles which is a serious squash.

1613,Saga began when I tried to book a seat several weeks prior to boarding. I went to the website and tried to follow the instructions but was unable to reserve a seat. Despite several attempts to do this over the next few days it would not work so I decided to go to the airport extra early (5 hours in advance of my flight). There were no aisle seats left despite me being so early so I decided to go ahead and book a “comfort” seat for which I was charged an additional 85 euros. Onboard I get to my “comfort” seat which is the aisle seat at the front right beside the washrooms. The aisle where everyone crosses in front of you. The man sitting beside me had also paid extra. His seat was ripped and the stuffing was coming out. He moved to the next seat over. Meanwhile people who had not paid the extra asked if they could sit in the other comfort seats (including the two by the window on each side which were much nicer and also vacant) and told that they could. We paid they did not they got better seats than we did. As we were taking off the air hostess told me to put my seat to the upright position I was surprised because I had not put it back. A few minutes later she told me the same thing. That’s when I realized the back of my seat was broken. The man behind me was unhappy with this and spent the entire flight pushing on my back in an effort to keep my seat more upright. It would stay for a while and then a passenger would walk past and push on the back of my seat for stability and back it would go. The man would push me forward someone else would push me back - this went on for 9 hours. One of the bathrooms went out of order (the bathrooms beside my seat). The staff did not put an out of order sign on the door. They knew it was out of order because I told them. People kept lining up. I would tell them it was out of order. They would walk to the other bathroom on the aisle in front of me. I would pull my feet up to let them pass - one more strike against my “comfort” seat. The man next to me was trying to work - every time someone walked past they hit his computer. He was very tall and got tripped over and bumped through the entire flight. The other bathroom at the front of the plane was put out of order. They ran out of toilet paper. I chose to avoid drinking for 9 hours so I could avoid the bathrooms. The plane was so old and decrepit. I fly several times a year for both business and pleasure.

1615,It pains me not to give Alitalia a high mark. Their inflight experience in Business Class is impressive. But it's everything leading up to the flight that is a disaster. Their website is outdated and nearly impossible to use. Their call center is a joke with incompetent agents who read off a script. And Alitalia will change flight times on a whim and penalize the traveler financially. In our experience after paying over $8000 for a ticket they charged an additional $850 for change fee and $1500 for fare difference when I asked for an earlier flight after they changed flight times from the original booking and shortened my connection time in Rome. They also changed my booking from Business to Economy and I had to make innumerable calls to their idiotic call center to try and resolve it. Once in the air the service was lovely from a friendly sharp-looking crew. The food is a showcase of the best of Italy with delicious pastas and breads served course-by-course. I don't drink but the wine list was extensive. They provide a high-end Ferragamo amenity kit. And the seats are lie-flat and great for a long sleep. The only drawback from the inflight experience is a poor IFE system with limited options and a dirty Business Class bathroom.

1616,LGW-HAV return. Bad from the start flight was shown as Gate Closed 10 minutes earlier than first advised I had issues at security and when I finally got to the gate way after it was supposed to have closed it was actually still open and no-one had been boarded at all. On the outbound trip we had good customer service with a friendly cabin crew. I found the seats a bit hard and also basic inclusions with other (airlines) economy cabins missing (but noticed you get them in premium economy for some more cash) - eg folding foot rest and movable headrests (it moved horizontally but the wings didn't adjust vertically). I always eat vegetarian on long haul usually you're served first. VA offered me a standard meal didn't seem to realised I'd book vegetarian. I had the misfortune to point it out to them and then was served with the most abysmal substitute for a meal with strong flavours of olives and capers that not everyone vegetarian or not is going to like. Thankfully I'm not veg so I asked for a standard meal staff were very good in trying to located something but only came up the veg option on the regular menu which was of equally abysmal quality and taste. What was worse 10 days later I got the exact same meal on the flight home. When I asked for something else this time the staff were disinterested and bordered on rude. Worst food I've had when flying. Wine was quite nice though. Inflight entertainment same standard but the touch screen takes some mastering (its not sensitive unless done in a certain way) and it's not a good idea to have to thump your screen when someone else's head is behind it most likely trying to sleep. Rack for brochures and personal items was either broken or just didn't close at the sides so any small items put in it just fell out not very secure. Flights themselves were smooth so hats off to the pilots they kept us informed through a long period of turbulence. Check in fine at both ends. Got a comfort pack for the night flight socks we're the thinnest I've ever been given.

1650,Belfast - Montreal return. A rather unpleasant experience from start to finish. Best part of the trip was the flight to London only because that was on a codeshare flight with another airline.

Guess US carriers are still years behind European and Asian one's. Why not just call it what it is extra leg room seats? Spent 3h playing on the phone as United appears to address their customers as idiots as this was a morning flight with mostly business passengers yet still playing a cartoon movie on the overhead monitors.

The first flight I was on had no video onboard not even screens on the center aisle. Second the return flight had video but the quality of the touch screens was so poor and unmanageable that I was not even tempted to watch a movie for fear of it being messed up. I noticed very few people watching movies on the screen - instead they read or watched movies on the tablets. I also noticed that the flight staff struggled to get the touch screens they used to work. They had to keep touching them to get it to respond. They really should fix that.

1693,Flew round trip from LAX to Rarotonga. The flight into Raro was fine except for the simply fair quality of food. The seating in economy was comfortable for a 9 hour overnight international flight. My primary complaint is about the terribly long lines for check-in at Raro for the Saturday night departure to LAX. The check-in counter is outside in a warm and humid climate and there are only 3 or 4 people working to serve scores of passengers and handle their baggage. We stood in line for over 1.5 hours even though we arrived 2 hours ahead of departure. There's obviously poor management for a process that occurs once per week and seemingly could easily be remedied by having a couple of more persons on staff for this check-in installation of some kiosks a faster computer system and some fans outside of the counter area.

It must have become all too much for three of the crew as they decided to take a seats in row one for 20/25 minutes taking about their children.

Arriving there 3.5 hours before the flight was due we decided to have something to eat. Then a got a message on my iphone: we are very sorry but your flight EZ 8883 has been cancelled.

Therefore I (fortunately) decided to change my booking online and managed to get a return flight the following day in the evening. Then after 1.5 hours an easyjet employee climbed on a stand and shouted that everybody should see to changing their booking themselves and that accommodation to spend the night had been arranged at the Hilton Hotel.

There is no real leg support and as the seat doesn't lay flat you are always sliding. The armrests are also hard and elbows are sore at the end of a long flight.

1712,Recently for our honeymoon we took advantage of a BA promo to fly in to Singapore and then to Hong Kong via Cathay Pacific and back to UK. Our flight out to Singapore was easy and relaxed because I think it was not a busy flight. We did ask to have a wedding photo canvas to be checked in to save us the hassle of lugging it around but was flatly refused. The canvas was less than 1kg properly packed for delivery but just slightly awkward to be carried around. We understand BA has a one bag check in policy and no flexibility but we were not too bothered anyway although a little kind gesture would have been appreciated. Our flight on Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong was great! We were allowed to check in 3 pieces of luggage between 2 of us that weighed less than 40kg food was fantastic and the service was immaculate. On our way back to London we were excited as we knew we were flying the A380. SQ and Emirates have A380 we have flown. This turned out to be a mistake from the start. When we were checking in we were not allowed to check in extra hand luggage despite the combined weight of less than 40kg for all 3 items. When we got on the plane we were shocked to see how tiny the seats on the BA A380 were in comparison to SQ or even Emirates. Next we struggled to find an overhead cabin compartment for our hand luggage. The staff instead of helping us find a space for the bag stood on her spot pointing at cabins that looked empty but were 10 over rows away from our seats. The ultimate bad experience came when breakfast was served. By the time the trolley came to us there were no more options for our breakfast and the food was just plonked on our trays. No apologies no explanations as to what was under the foil no smiles! I was quite upset by now as I had to ask the stewardess what was being served. I have never felt more humiliated. With BA it was just silence. Miserable unhappy lifeless crews at work who can't seem to care less with their customers. No smiles no interactions no explanations no communication. Needless to say the highly unpopular dim sum with noodles for breakfast was left untouched!

The economy comfort seats on Delta were not much better than economy - a little more legroom, but the inclination seemed the same. I couldn't sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. The economy comfort seats on the connecting flights felt more comfortable. Delta offered a wide range of entertainment options. I only fly with Delta because my wife buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I wouldn't recommend Delta for long-haul flights because of the uncomfortable seats. Next time my wife and I fly to Europe or Asia, I will ask her to use her FF miles for flights with a Delta partner with better seats."

Surprisingly the food went downhill from that point. For the first meal I ordered the filet - it was cold overcooked and tough inedible. Hours later the next meal was the same. The duck was greasy stringy and tough. I noticed that the entrees were lined up open on top of the trolley before serving. Passengers at the rear got cold congealed food! Because they were slow with the service the food cooked too long then sat open the whole time. I tried to refuel with their ever available noodles but these came mushy though fragrant.

1769,Flew TK 1332 BRE-IST then TK 716 IST-DEL round-trip. I booked the flight quite spontaneously and TK was surprisingly cheap. Having read that TK is quite good I was a little bit disappointed. Though the food was really great (the Turkish delight is delicious and I like the idea of the fresh orange juice) and I was even given a second menu the staff disappointed me. Perhaps it was only me but I didn't feel very welcome their English wasn't always understandable. Furthermore my flight from Bremen to Istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting. When the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun. Unfortunately there was no help offered by the FAs.

1788,"I was very disappointed by the Singapore Airlines business class travel experienced recently. My partner and I flew from Australia to Europe and back with Singapore Airlines three sectors on the A380 and one on a B777.

The beds in the fully flat position are quite comfortable but unlike other business class seats there is no smooth transition from sitting to lying - you are required to 'make' the bed. When in the bed position there is no comfortable backrest to allow you to sit comfortably - hence the large number of business travellers seen sitting cross-legged in bed throughout the flight!

All I can say is that I might even save my next flight for second class. The only thing that is not obese is that I have broad hips and shoulders and am of a larger than average height. The seats in the Boeing 777-300ER were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the rest of my flight (Dubai London), with less legroom and minimal adjustment of the backrest. Sleep is impossible. The service was very average, the crew seemed to be constantly busy jogging their bulky cars in the narrow passages where food was running short. The entertainment options do not compensate for the inconvenience of the whole experience. Of course, more cash-strapped customers will be offered comfort. I really resent that! Will try to look at the type of plane before flying again."
1791,"I have never been spoken to so rudely or treated with such contempt. I understood I should check in online but as I had problems printing this I was lead to understand that all details would be held by Ryanair and this would be fine. The staff were rude and unhelpful.

My partner and myself both have eye problems and when I again requested some assistance I was very curtly told ""just put your glasses on"". We struggled to use the PC only to discover that the printer was in fact out of order. I was left with no option but to pay £140 for two boarding passes to be printed at the touch of a button. We eventually got ourselves and a single case weighing 20.03kg on our way to Corfu.

My wife and I had a sleep after dinner when we woke 2 hours before arrival we decided to have a drink. I pressed the call bell and ordered a baileys and a glass of wine. I was first told that the bar had closed which was nonsense after I complained they sent down a supervisor where a long argument presumed in which they basically told myself and my wife we were too intoxicated to have anymore drink!

1815,We were disappointed at the decline in standards. Since our last flight the standard and quantity of food has reduced. On both outward and inbound flights the main meal was chicken on the return chicken in curry sauce with dried up rice. Previously free wine and beer was available this is now a thing of the past and we were only offered soft drinks. On the outward journey the cabin crew seemed disinterested the crew on the return were more customer friendly but were speaking to each other over the voice of the captain giving messages.

1816,Very dissatisfied! Today I had a flight from Charleston to Phoenix with a one hour lay over in Houston. Very little time to switch terminals but scheduled by United. While waiting I learned the Charleston flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Told by flight attendant that this is due to one crew member coming late to the flight causing the delay. Now I have 30 min to get to flight which will not happen and have to stay night in Houston. United has reserved flight at 07.30 next morning. Problem: Parking has been prepaid on my vehicle only until my arrival time. My luggage is already in Phoenix as it left on earlier flight. No reservations in Houston for stay. No meal arrangements. I will refuse to travel with United in the future. Just a note. United has offered meal vouchers and hotel.,0,"Very unhappy!

1817,Addis Ababa to Cairo via Sana'a. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was very good. The planes were relatively new and in good condition. And this flight was at least $250 cheaper than all other alternatives for this route with other airlines. My only concern was the fact that I bought the ticket online from Bravofly.co.uk and got a confirmation number with no other instructions. However when I showed up at the airport I was told that my tickets were cancelled because I didn't reconfirm the flight 72 hours in advance with a local office. I've never had to do this for a flight for which I had already paid.

1818,"Flew Brasilia-London-Lisbon-Brasilia in Business class not for the first time. It's never been great but this time the aircraft on the transatlantic legs were simply dreadful offering Business class from about 1990. Really ancient A330s with basic seats and an IFE that doesn't allow you to stop/start films on request and which offered only about six films anyway. These days that's just pathetic. On the last leg (LIS-BSB) there were only nine (9) people in Business and still I couldn't get my first choice meal - attendant said ""only two trays of the chicken were boarded"" - so I had overcooked and tasteless veal instead. On more than one occasion attendants on TAP have encouraged me to write and complain - they clearly feel passengers aren't getting a good deal. On these flights in June 2014 attendants were just great - thereby just about saving the airline in my view. We use TAP because I can get to the UK in only two flights from Brasilia not three. If other airlines were to offer this I'd take it - and Air France are starting to do so. So I'll be reviewing my bookings.

1822,PRG-BRU-EDI Brussels Airlines is effectively a low-cost airline disguised as a proper national flag-carrier. Cramped aircraft with extremely uncomfortable seats and on both legs of my flight absolutely no overhead luggage space meaning that I had to keep my briefcase under my feet. There were two of us in our party and yet somehow we weren't seated next to each other - and the issue was explained to me as being unsolvable by ground staff. Absurd amounts of queuing for boarding and disembarking although the way boarding was called- one would believe that there was some logic being employed. Absolutely nothing is handed for free if you are flying Economy - not even water which again goes back to the point that they are operating as a low-cost carrier. Cost of a tickets is slightly lower than the cost of ticket on e.g. Lufthansa but not as low as Easyjet or Ryanair both of which in my opinion offer a direct service superior to Brussels Airlines. Also on a side note - Brussels Airport which is the airline's hub is a nightmare.,0,"PRG-BRU-EDI Brussels Airlines is basically a low-cost airline disguised as a proper national carrier.

1823,Sydney-Perth Saturday afternoon service. Unfortunately the weekend flights use the older aircraft and not the new Airbus A330s with lie flat seats. Cabin manager is assigned to business class only (4 passengers) and was attentive upon boarding hanging my jacket and offering beverages with a choice of water or a mocktail there was no champagne or sparkling to be seen.

The samsung in flight entertainment systems were handed out however after looking through the selection I instantly regretted not bringing my own laptop as the selection for a 5hr flight was extremely poor. The 3 course meal was delicious and service was good for most of the flight however I had to wait for the bathroom twice the first time as several economy passengers were using the designated business class bathroom and the second time as 4 members of the crew were talking in the front of the cabin blocking the way.

1829,I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi.

Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls).

Some of the flight attendants don't speak English well and one of the flight attendants on the flight from Chicago to Beijing was obviously very new and was struggling - but tried none-the-less. At check-in there always seems to be confusion about what the transfer process is in Beijing. One of the real pains is that they will not issue you both tickets when you check in. If your transfer time is more than 4 hours be prepared to sit in the airport until they open the check-in counter.

You will have to go through immigration and customs so do fill out both the arrival and departure forms (despite any advice to the contrary which we received from flight attendants). The immigration process is not straightforward and we were shuffled from line to line despite being in the correct line to begin with.

1838,JNB-CDG 4th February. Short haul is pleasant enough and efficient (though avoid Paris Charles de Gaulle if at all possible Orly is a delight). Long haul (A380 economy) was a short haul experience on a long haul flight. I found the seats were thinly padded and barely reclined food short-haul standard.

1841,London Luton to Knock Mayo West of Ireland yesterday 16/10/13 on the 11.50am flight. I checked online before leaving and no reported delays. I also checked on the screen upon entering the airport at approx. 10.15am and again no reported delays (only information was flight information and check-in desk to go to). Then after going through quite a security queue I'd been informed by another passenger that the flight had been delayed until 3pm which was confirmed on the displays. The scheduled time then varied from approx. 2.45 to 4pm changing quite regularly. So after a considerable time spent waiting at the airport the flight finally took off well after 3.15pm (by this time I was sitting on the plane and too tired to note the time of takeoff). I would recommend implementing a free beverage/drink for all customers in cases where any flight is more than 2 (or 2.5hrs) late. As this would show an acknowledgement the apology by the company and would not cost the company very much in terms of stock.

1844,"Twice now I have flown Etihad, booked on South African code share flights, it has not been great. On the first case I was booked business class, but when I got to check-in, Etihad did not have me on the flight list on a full flight, despite SAA being able to provide the codes. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure to know whether I would be able to fly and then it was in economy class. I was promised follow up - the flight controller even confirmed my email address - I am still waiting. The second time, today, flight EY471 from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was delayed by three hours. I fly a lot, and I know these things happen. The proof is in how the airline treats you when they do. I am carrying a letter saying that hotels are booked if the new connection required more than eight hours waiting time. Mine requires fifteen. As I could not access a hotel (transit hotel full and I need a visa for any others) I was given food vouchers and told to wait in the terminal. I had to argue for lounge access (this time I am flying economy, but it seemed logical as lounge access Appears to me a notch down from the promised hotel accommodation). I was told it is full. Eventually the desk took pity on me and granted me five hours in the lounge. When I got to the lounge, lo and behold, it was empty. And just now Etihad refused to renew my voucher - from the mouth of an uninterested and unapologetic desk officer. I was also sent to and fro from the SAA desk to Etihad to sort out boarding passes. I have flown SAA for many years, and with many of its Star Alliance partners. I have two thoughts coming out of these experiences, one that I would not choose Etihad or an Etihad code share flight ever again if I can avoid it: even if the in-flight experience is good enough.

1870,We went on a one-week vacation to beautiful Samana. Upon arrival to the Ottawa Airport we couldn't check in using my husbands passport due to WestJet making a mistake on his name. A very nice representative helped us at Ottawa airport to check in using my passport. On the flight from Toronto to Samana I ended up in the middle seat besides a drunken passenger who just shut the window blind down and spent the entire trip sleeping and invading my personal space. Those planes are small so having to fight off your little space with another passenger is draining. My husband sitting on the alley chair had half his elbow bumped several times by one of the flight attendants. The plane was smelly but at least it wasn't visibly dirty this time. In-flight food: Their free offerings were the poorest I've had the displeasure of experiencing: tiny glasses of water/soft drink/coffee and just two 14 grams bags of cookies or sesame sticks for a 4 hours flight. I understand this was supposed to be a value flight but it wasn't the least expensive in the bunch when compared with Air Canada offerings. All the above mentioned would have been forgiven and forgotten had it not been for the nightmarish experience we had on our flight back. As stated we were among the first to arrive at Samana airport once there we were given two seats together (window and middle): all nice until we got on the flight. The seats were not reclining and we had not been informed. Once the people in front of us reclined we realized that it was impossible for us to do the same. My husband called the flight attendant thinking there was a way of reclining but she just said it was not possible in a rushed manner as if we were a nuisance. For four hours we had to sit uncomfortably with our knees being constantly banged by the hyper kids sitting in front of us and without any possibility of rest. I do believe that if the airline is going to take away a passengers right to a reclining chair/cabin space they should at least offer some kind of compensation be it in the way of a pillow for their sore-necks or a food voucher. To make things worse the cabin on the flight back to Toronto was extremely dirty. The smell could be catalogued more as a stench. The cherry on top was that our connection to Ottawa was delayed for 30 minutes or more due to WestJet having a flight from Cancun being delayed also so we ended up missing our bus connection at the airport.,0,"We went on a week-long holiday in beautiful Samana.

All the above would have been forgiven and forgotten if we had not had the nightmarish experience on the return flight. As I said, we were among the first to arrive at Samana airport, when we arrived there we got two seats together (window and center): all fine until we took the flight. The seats were not in place and we had not been informed. When people were leaning back before us, we realized that it was impossible for us to do the same. My husband called the flight attendant and thought there was a way to lie down, but she just said it was not possible in a hurry, as if we were a nuisance.

1881,My original rant today starts because of Air Canada's online flight tracker.

After spending the night trying to retrieve my medical supplies in the city we went home exhausted again. They had the nerve the next day to tell me to come and get my supplies.

I call the Porter call centre because I'm stranded at the airport. Finally, they agreed to accompany me (and pay) to Brantford for the night and bring me home the next day.

1887,Dreadful. I fly frequently between Bristol and Frankfurt where unfortunately there is no other choice of operator for this route. Lufthansa/Eurowings took over this route approximately 18 months ago and I have flown around 10 times. Every single one of flights has been blighted with a problem ranging from serious (emergency divert to Heathrow due to mechanical failure of the aircraft) to trivial but highly irritating (about 70% of my bookings from Frankfurt fail to appear on the e-Tix system). I would not recommend Eurowings to anyone and if an alternative carrier is available (and even if you have to pay a little extra) avoid the pain and fly with them instead.,0,"Awful.

1889,My wife and I live in Singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit family/friends. Emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. It is therefore with sadness that I have to complain about the in-flight service received on flight EK37 on 10th July which was the beginning of a tour of the UK. We have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. However on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chit-chat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. Throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an ever-growing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. Furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. During meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong ‘end’. Consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other ‘end’. This has somewhat clouded our view of Emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again.,0,"My wife and I live in Singapore and therefore fly quite often to see relatives / friends.

1890,Dalaman - Manchester. Onur Air return flight should have left at 16.30 Turkish time. Advised at check in that there was a delay. Had real trouble getting any answers re the delay from Ground Staff and just left to look at the Departures Board. Plane left at 23.30 so seven hour delay. We did get a burger meal for free at 18.00 and still no idea of when the plane was leaving. Eventually bordered the plane and the pilot said that it was a technical fault.

1891,Yesterday I was flying Copenhagen-Madrid-A Coruna. First nothing is served on the plane not even a cup of coffee despite the flying time of 3.5 hours from CPH-Madrid. The planes are old-fashioned poor leg space no service. Upon arrival in Madrid Spanish officials were screaming in Spanish unable to speak English. From a kind fellow passenger I could understand that the flight to A Coruna was cancelled. We were given the options to get on a bus (approx 7 hours - from 9pm) or get a flight the next day (without hotel option). Most of us went for the bus option and picked up our luggage where after we waited for further instructions.

The rest of my family were seated in row 21 and myself in a middle seat in row 17.

1900,"Operated by Portugalia, two very different stories. On the first leg, nice crew, good tasty sandwich and drink, old but good airplane which was clean, priority boarding with infants respected, all-in-all positive experience and would fly with them again. On the return leg, TAP Portugal's Porto ground staff decided to ruin my day. I am a Star Alliance silver member and should have had no issue with luggage. But for some reason they now told me that my two bags were overweight (30 instead of 23 kg) and that I had to pay 50 EUR each supplement to carry them to BRU, even though I had exactly the same amount of luggage going to OPO, this apparently did not matter. They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply. As for the return flight itself, it was just as good as the one coming into OPO. So a real pity, a nice product but ruined by some ground staff in OPO and some very restrictive rules on luggage.

The equipment was somewhat cleaner than usual although AC still refuses to provide headrest covers like the Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel.

Boarding procedures have drastically improved with the implementation of zones although many pax still do not understand the cabin baggage size and weight limits. AC has an inconsistent approach to this issue and I could see that some economy cabin pax were going to be made uncomfortable by a few selfish people. Desk agents on all segments were polite and pleasant to deal with. Baggage delivery at Canadian airports was slow as usual.

The equipment was a little cleaner than usual, although AC still refuses to offer headrest covers, as Asian airlines do. Not the most hygienic approach to air travel. The new ceilings are a welcome change."
1908,My son flew alone with Flybe and was informed his flight from Glasgow would not make the connecting flight from Birmingham to Düsseldorf. He was sent to an airport hotel and given a dinner voucher. At no time were we as parents informed by a member of Flybe staff.

1909,Travelled to Orlando via Philly and had a bad trip due to the incompetence of US Airways. Booked for a family of 6 (4 adults and 2 children 6 and 8) and was given split seats. I was told by the staff that we should ask the people who were in the seats next to some of us if they would move to let our family stay together. Got to Philly and heard a blurb over the tannoy so I went to the desk and asked about it and was abruptly told to wait. Asked again about sitting together only to be told the same thing again at least that's standardisation for you. The return flight was worse with inconsiderate flight attendants no back of the seat screen and again had to sort ourselves out with other families.

1910,I'm a regular traveller albeit mainly short haul. When visiting friends I wanted to experience a flight on an Airbus 380 in Business. Big disappointment but waited to form an opinion until after the return flight. In my view there are just too many business class passengers to cabin crew and it is just not possible to get the level of service you expect from a business class flight. Significantly inferior to other aircraft configurations. Food quality was poor and you are left without being asked if you would like a glass of wine to go with your meal. By the time they arrive the meal is finished. I would recommend you avoid this if you want a high level experience. I usually try to fly via Doha with Qatar when going in this direction and will return to that route of travel in future.,0,"I am a regular traveller, albeit mainly on short-haul flights.

1911,On a recent flight EK435 (A380) from Brisbane to Dubai on the 18th of April 2015 the flight had a technical problem shortly after passengers were boarded at 20.30 hrs. Resolution took over 3.5 hours during which all passengers were kept on the airplane with no food or drinks. Water and some fruit juice was distributed reluctantly by the crew after being repeatedly asked it appeared they did not want to go through the bother of having to open and close the trolleys before the flight took off! The Captain made a few sporadic announcements in the 1st hour of waiting and then disappeared leaving announcements to the Purser. All in all the 14 hour flight took all of 17+ hours.

No escape from inadequate films. Trying to sleep was impossible being woken every 20/30 minutes with some announcement or other.

I note when another carrier recently went into completion with them for the Aberdeen route from Leeds Bradford their prices dropped dramatically.

I had to take a later flight which got me to my destination later than had I used the train at a significantly lower cost. The last two flights from DTV to Aberdeen were late and cancelled also. Technical problems sometimes occur and have to be accepted but it seems much more common lately. This airline is unreliable and accepts bookings offering flexibility and then removes the flexibility.

Eastern Airways cancelled 4 of them on the return flight after accepting my booking and payment for operational reasons, which were half-term holidays and the like. I had to take a later flight, which took me to my destination later, when I had used the train at a significantly lower price. The last two flights from DTV to Aberdeen were delayed and cancelled. Technical problems sometimes arise and must be accepted, but lately it seems to be much more common. This airline is unreliable and accepts bookings that offer flexibility, and then removes that flexibility. I note that another assessment of offshore workers states that no one in the industry has a good word for them, and I agree with his statement. An experience for low-cost airlines at top prices. I'm travelling by train now"
1931,"My family took a long haul flight with Lufthansa to Berlin via Frankfurt. They only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it. To add to the insult, we were told we had to take the flight to Berlin, or they would re-calculate the total cost.

The only thing I can say positively is that the food was really fantastic quite unexpected for in-flight cuisine. The drinks also came very consistently. The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured.

1953,A frequent flyer with GTK Rossiya since I have to travel a lot within CIS and Europe. Recently I have decided to give up the choice in favour for this airline for good. First and major issue is there online booking service. Even if you have booked a flight online and you cc was charged it does not mean you are done. Often flights are being cancelled. Customer service do not even bother to inform the passengers about the changes in advance they just rebook you for another flight on another date (that happens!) and then refuse to make a full refund if you decide to completely cancel your itinerary due to the fact they have cancelled the flight on exact date you needed. To reach their head office in St Petersburg by phone is a nearly impossible mission since it is permanently busy. Reaching customer support toll free number is useless since they will anyway send you out for a personal visit to their office. As you can imagine it is very handful for business travellers. Visit to the office is a guaranteed 2 hours waiting in a queue. A typical Russian service for a not so cheap price after all. They do not have to care about customers satisfaction since they will anyway hold up to 60% of the market. There are basically only two sufficient airlines in Russia - Rossiya and Aeroflot. Both state owned and both with beyond bad approach to customers. Unfortunately no other choice. Its a shame that a huge country like Russia with distances of up to 10000 km from Central to Far East destinations can not offer its citizens an airline we could be proud of. Do not fly with Rossiya Airlines unless you have no other choice of course.,0,"A frequent flyer with GTK Rossiya, as I have to travel a lot within the CIS and Europe.

Reaching their headquarters in St. Petersburg by telephone is an almost impossible mission, as it is constantly manned.

Maybe it was a language barrier but I certainly felt my family and I as well as non-Chinese passengers did not received the same pleasant service as Chinese passengers.

I will never fly this airline again. Maybe it was a language barrier, but I felt that my family and I, as well as non-Chinese passengers, did not receive the same pleasant service as Chinese passengers. The service with food and drink seemed very random and disorganized. They often left passengers to drink, and flight attendants appeared to bump into each other as they served. The food wasn't the best, but I can't complain because it's economy airline food. Plane was old and outdated. The TV was grainy and the free headsets didn't work. I did not know that ""airplane mode"" was prohibited on the mobile phone, but I followed this rule, even though all the other passengers should have enforced this rule, as I counted five other passengers who had broken this rule within sight of the cabin crew.

1955,MAN-LCY. Arrived at MAN about 1hr 45mins before departure and had to wait about 20 mins for check- in to open. I tried to use the self-service machine but couldn't get it to accept my eTicket number. Once check-in had opened a friendly agent spotted that I was only carrying hand baggage and pulled me out of the queue and successfully got me checked in using the s/s machine. Gate (03C) was announced about half an hour before boarding. Gate area is on ground floor directly opening onto the apron and was very poorly heated! Boarding was by bus to the aircraft at a stand. The plane a Fokker 50 was very cold on boarding but soon warmed up once the engines were started. Internally it looked a little tired but who cares on such a short trip? Seat pitch in row 8 was excellent. Inflight magazine said 32 inches but it felt more than that. Cabin crew did an excellent job of serving lunch (cheese or ham rolls) drinks and a chocolate to the quite full flight in the short time available (they also handed out boiled sweets before pushback). The flight continues from LCY to LUX and continuing passengers don't have to disembark - virtually everyone who boarded at MAN disembarked at LCY though. All in all a very pleasant experience. I usually only ever fly between Manchester and London at times like Christmas when there's no/poor train service but the convenient location of LCY for me (living in Kent) means that I would consider this route again - especially if I can't get a cheap advance ticket on the train in which case VLM's fares are often a quite reasonable alternative.,0,"MAN-LCY.

1956,April 24 AC 7971. It is hard to imagine what management thinks about when they make decisions totally focused on the bottom line rather than customer service. So with service now inferior flight comfort at an all time low then why use AC? I was loyal but no longer.

1964,I flew economy from Brisbane to London via Hong Kong. The first leg Brisbane to Hong Kong was very busy and I took the view that the cabin crew were very pressed. Hence they made mistakes. For example I asked for red wine and got white wine despite the stewardess repeating my order to me. Water was served from plastic jugs and tasted of cleaning fluid. Clearly they had not been rinsed properly. And unlike most other airlines on such long haul routes there was no overnight pack (containing eg. toothpaste and toothbrush etc).

1965,Edinburgh to Chambery on Dec 27th. The weather was poor so Jet2 unloaded ski bags before departure to enable them to carry extra fuel.

They are being greedy and looking after their profits and with no care for the passengers who need to get to their destinations or connecting flights.

This is an absolute fraud and an insult to passengers. Horrific customer service, no manager ever to be found and just one or two ground staff to deliver messages to frustrated passengers."

1983,We flew LGA-YUL and back on AC. My finance and I flew out separately and returned together. Staff were polite enough in LGA but displayed a consistently lackadaisical attitude. They didn't start boarding the flights until 10 minutes or less before scheduled departure (even though the plane had been at the gate for at least 30 minutes prior) so predictably both flights pulled back from the gate late. My flight then took a 30 minute tour around the taxiways which granted AC has no control over but they provided no updates or anything until we finally started our take off. On the return trip we first ran in to possibly the rudest person working a service job I've ever encountered at YUL. The second AC employee we dealt with was quite nice and apologized for her co-worker. Again at the gate the staff was lackadaisical fumbling around and not boarding the flight until 10 minutes before departure (even though the boarding pass said boarding would start 55 minutes prior to departure and the plane was at the gate for a good 20 minutes at least before boarding started). Luckily it only lead to 5-10 minutes delay on the YUL-LGA trip. On all 3 flights there were no announcements about how or where to pick up baggage when we landed. Overall I feel like we were lucky that our AC experience was only somewhat bad. The general attitude and competency of the AC staff gave me absolutely no confidence that they would have been able to handle any real problems.

My flight then led to a 30-minute round trip around the runways, which AC had no control over, but they provided no updates or anything until we finally started taking off. On the way back we first met perhaps the most unfriendly person doing a service job I have ever experienced at YUL. The second AC employee we dealt with was quite nice and apologised for her colleague. Back at the gate, the staff fumbled with laughter and boarded the flight 10 minutes before departure (although the boarding pass stated that boarding would start 55 minutes before departure and the plane would be at the gate at least 20 minutes before boarding).
