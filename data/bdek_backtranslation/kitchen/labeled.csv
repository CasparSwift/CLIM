0,"	Perfectly fits the books' atmosphere
	For those of you unfamiliar with the ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" books, they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional Baudelaire orphans, and their struggles to overcome adversity (after adversity, after adversity, ad infinitum).  Hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional, brief glimpses of happiness, is their distant cousin, the scheming, greedy, conniving, ruthless cousin, the Count.


Given the concept of the story, this poster fits perfectly, with the orphans, standing together but otherwise alone, in the middle, with the shadow of the Count casting gloom upon them.  It is a perfect fit, as is the casting of Jim Carrey as the Count

2,"	Worked for us
	I purchased 3 units and they work well for us.  I have 2 units in children's bedrooms on AC power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability.  The sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy.  The best thing about these units is the VOX answer option.  I have this option turned on in the kid's room and they merely have to answer back when I talk to them first without having to push the ""talk"" button.  This is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that doesn't quite understand how to use this.  I attached a large, very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and I keep it on my fridge; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary.  The only small annoying feature is every time the ""talk"" button is pressed, a beep occurs.  But the other features outweight that small annoyance for me

3,"	New Fry-guy - pretty pleased....
	I've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern. 

I must say, overall, I am quite pleased. While I am new to frying, I found it extraordinarily easy (it is pretty hot though, so be careful).  Only complaint would be that the capacity is a  little on the small side, say if you're cooking entrees for a larger family (for example, you can really only fit 3 (MAYBE 4) pieces of chicken at a time).  But since the chicken needs to cool down anyway, this wasn't such a major issue.  It came out nice, crispy, and golden brown - not too soggy, not too crisp - perfect.  

I figure if it can handle the chicken, vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake.  Although I've only fried a couple of batches, I am beyond pleased - but I'll let you know if I have any problems...  Great item so far though.

4,"	Excellent fryer
	Easy to use, easy to clean. Two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy. This thing is easier to clean than my old George Foreman Grill (and that to me was a pain in the neck). The only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil, which I do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much I've used it and what I've cooked. If I'm doing just veggies, I keep the oil. If I do a meat or seafood, I'll change the oil right after. 
Very pleased overall.

9,"	Excellent Product and Transaction
	The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised. It has three nested work bowls. The inner, smallest one takes a special blade (a smaller version of the standard processor blade). It's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things. Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something. The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest, 12 cup bowl.

A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box (finally, a way to keep everything together). The unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl. It's the kind with the rotating hub (two hub sizes are included, one for lemons and a larger one for oranges, etc). While it seems to work, it's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black  and  Decker, but what the heck, it's worth trying.

The motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it. At first I was disappointed that there weren't any fancy front panel switch options, but after thinking about it, you only need the provided On, Off and Pulse.

Would I buy it again? Absolutely. Would I buy it again from Amazon? Again, absolutely. The transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised

18,"	Excellent kid's game
	As a mathematician, game theorist, and proud Chi Omicron Chi (XOX, aka ""Xocks"") brother, I have always been interested in this the simplest of m,n,k games, i.e. games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row.  As every game theorist knows, perfect tic-tac-toe play by both players results in a tie game every time, with neither player achieving victory.  The clever child will figure this out on her own, as I did at an early age, and I lost interest in playing tic-tac-toe before I turned five.  I never lost interest, however, in studying tic-tac-toe and similar games, which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory, and partly accounts for my joining Chi Omicron Chi as a college freshman.  As part of our initiation, pledges had to play a modified form of tic-tac-toe with vodka-filled shot glasses for markers.  Each player had five glasses, and as he placed his marker, he would empty his glass.  The loser would drink the remaining shot glasses.  Most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic-tac-toe, so really the point of the game, as with most fraternity games, was to see who could best hold his liquor.  I do remember one unfortunate pledge, Bob, who never figured out how to play perfect tic-tac-toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia.

All these thoughts came rushing, so to speak, back to me when I saw the ""Shot Glasses Tic-Tac-Toe"" available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component.  I have a four-year-old son who has yet to perfect his tic-tac-toe game, so I bought this set to educate him.  We play the same way I did in the Xocks fraternity house.  Of course I don't give him pure vodka in his shot glasses; he only weighs 35 lbs.  As 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight, I dilute his vodka in a 1-to-4 dilution with orange juice.  I know what you're thinking: what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses, including mine?  I am nothing if not fair, so when he loses, I give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka I have remaining in my shot glasses.  Since I, knowing how to play perfect tic-tac-toe, never lose to my son, the reverse problem, my having to drink his remaining shots, never occurs.

My son loses more often than not, and he usually ends up walking into walls, falling down, and later becoming violently sick.  You would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic-tac-toe, but his cognitive development must be lacking.  I can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic-tac-toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections.  He still loves to play, however, but his game, if anything, seems to be getting worse, almost as if he is trying to lose

25,"	Expensive but well worth it
	I made plenty of pizzas on several types of thin metal baking pans, and the results were consistenly mediocre.

Now however, with this pizza stone, I no long find myself ordering pizza for delivery.

1 cup water or beer
2 1/2 cups flour (maybe a 1/4-cup of whole-wheat flour mixed in)
1 package of dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon butter

Knead and let rise twice (I used to do it by hand, but now I have a bread maker which works perfectly for this purpose on the 'dough' setting).  This makes two pizzas around 14 inches in diameter.  Either roll them out with a rolling pin, or press them into shape by hand.  The dough seems to be too elastic to ""throw"" it into shape - I think it's a skill that takes a long while to master.

I make pizza sauce with a can of tomato paste, some red wine and/or water, chopped parsley, chopped basil, dried oregano, chopped garlic and chopped onion.  I've also used pasta sauce (prego or ragu) with acceptable results.

I almost always top with mozarella and thinly-sliced mushrooms.

I use parchment baking paper under the pizza.  I slide it on and off the stone this way, without resorting to corn meal.  This works perfectly for me every time.

Heat the oven up _HOT_ (500 degrees).  It will only take 5 minutes to bake at this temperature.  When the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges, it is done.  The crust is golden-brown on the bottom, with just a bit of crunch.  If I let the crust rise a bit after preparing the pizza, it will be softer and thicker.

Store-bought frozen pizzas are also better when cooked on this stone.

I'm giving only 4 stars because of the price.  There must be a cheaper alternative to this stone, but I'm not complaining too much, because I've thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas it's produced

	I just received my Jiffy Steamer J-4000 Pro-Line.  It was missing a funnel which would be no big deal if they had not printed the words ""USE ENCLOSED FUNNEL"" in caps every where.  I sent an email and they said they will send me one (they seem to have a good customer service).

Now that we have dispensed with the whining, lets talk about the product itself.  If you need sharp lines on your pants or shirt stick with your iron, this is not for you.  However if you would like to take wrinkles out of your clothes and you don't want to bother with hanging them in the bathroom while you take a shower or taking them out of the dryer on time, this does do an amazing job.

I have also purchased a JIFFY personal hand held steamer that works fairly well and provides adequate amount of steam for most of your needs.  However if you take wrinkles out frequently and have the space go for J-4000.  You get the wrinkles out faster.

If you have a concern about startup time, you do have some control over that.  I just put enough cold water in there for a few shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes.  If you put hot water out of the tab and reduce the amount of water you can get even quicker startup time.  Or you can put it on standby in the morning before you go to the shower and put it on steam when you are ready to use it.  Standby setting uses a thermostat to keeps the water temperature at 90C degrees (close to boiling).  

If you can afford it, buy one.  It would make a great re-gift item if you find out that you don't like it
",1,"Buy it, but keep your iron. I just got my Jiffy Steamer J-4000 Pro-Line. There was no funnel missing, which would not be a big deal if they hadn't printed the words ""USE ENCLOSED FUNNEL"" in caps everywhere. I emailed them and they said they would send me one (they seem to have good customer service). Now that we have dispensed with whining, let us talk about the product itself. If you need sharp lines on your trousers or shirt stick with the iron, this is not for you. However, if you want to remove wrinkles from your clothes and you don't want to bother hanging them in the bathroom while you shower or get them out of the dryer in time, then this does an amazing job. I also bought a JIFFY steam oven, which works pretty well and provides enough steam for most of your needs. However, if you often take out wrinkles and have room for J-4000. You get out the wrinkles quicker. If you have concerns about the start time, you have some control over it. I just poured in enough cold water for a couple of shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes. If you remove hot water from the tab and reduce the amount of water, you can get to the start time even faster. Or you can put it on standby in the morning before showering and let it steam when you are ready to use it. When set to standby, the water temperature is kept at 90 ° C (close to boiling) using a thermostat. If you can afford it, buy one."

34,"	Have used and loved this product for three years
	I have used this filter daily for over a year and love it. At first I tried using it in a ""Mr. Coffee"" style machine, but found that my coffee grind was too fine and the water would filter through too slowly and overflow if I made more than 2 cups. 

Since I make coffee for one or two people usually, and don't like to leave the coffee on the hot pad, so this was okay for me.

Then I switched to single-cup method using a drip filter holder that fits over the cup. I bought it along with a cup at a Starbucks about 3 years ago.

One thing that is great about the SwissGold filter is that it cleans so easily. The first time I rinsed it out I took a paper towel to the inside and it came out clean. I was very surprised. (Not so with the plastic filter holder.) 

The taste is great, and I haven't purchased coffee filters in 3 years. Once I tried it with a coarse grind coffee in my coffemaker, which I received as a gift, and that worked out okay, too.

Currently I am using it with my caffiene free Teeccino herbal coffees (help me keep my blood pressure normal under stress), and the filter works very well with those blends.

So I highly recommend it. It pays for itself if you are looking at it from that aspect.

	This may sound odd, but this is the first steamer that I have ever had. So needless to say, I do not have others to compare it to. However,I find that I use it more than I thought I would! The unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that I most use for vegies and the like, and when I pull out the sides (the steaming tray) it fits nicely up the sides of the pot. Besides your basic steamed vegies, I find that it's perfect for warming up leftovers like rice, leaving it hot and fluffy. I like that the handle extends, so you can keep the cover on it while cooking, but you can extend the handle for easier lifting. And you can't beat the price

	This Dutch Oven is a workhorse in my kitchen.  I purchased it pre-seasoned because I've never had a factory-seasoned piece of cast iron cookware.  Bottom line:  While the pre-seasoning was a plus, it's not necessary.  Just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the Lodge cookware, and you'll be fine.

My family has had cast iron for generations, and I won't pay the exhorbitant prices for those ""upscale, professional"" dutch ovens that are all the rage these days.  This Lodge oven browns spectacularly, and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one, that's not a problem if one simply uses one's nose.  We can all tell when enough is enough...   

I particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which aren't present on the more expensive ones.  These spikes allow condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and I don't have to worry about a dry product.  The lid on this oven also fits the 12-inch skillet which I own, and that's a plus.  It conducts heat well and when I use it camping as an oven, breads and biscuits come out as well as at home.  

Yes, it's heavy, but that's the nature of cast iron, no??  If you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this Lodge piece, be prepared to shell out big bucks

I have a hard time remembering exact spefications because it died after 6 months, and I hadn't even mixed anything heavy with it!

This little hand mixer takes it all--even stiff cookie dough like roll-out sugar cookies.  And it mixes every last bit of the flour in.  Beaters don't clog, dough mixes up smooth.

50,"	An elegantly designed LONG  and  WIDE toaster
	The Braun HT500 is one of the best designed toasters I have ever used. What I really like....

1. A single long  and  wide slot, allowing you to toast large or unusually shaped pieces of bread. I have used it to toast very thick pieces of bread, long hoagee rolls, and those huge hamberger buns that won't fit in a standard toaster slot.

2. Very clean, modern appearance.  Looks great sitting on the kitchen counter, whereas many of the other toaster models today look like ugly chrome spaceships from the 1950's.  Personally, I'm not into that kind of retro look.

3. An led light that is clearly visible when the toaster is ""on"", allowing you to quickly see the status of your toast from the other side of the room.

4. When the toast is done, it pops-up only part way. This helps keep your toast warm prior to you extracting it. You then pull the lever up a notch higher and it raises the toast up very high, making it easy to pull-out even very small pieces of bread.

5. It toasts evenly.  Of course, you would expect this.  But you'd be surprised how some very expensive toasters I've used in the past were often poor in this area.

Of all those items, the first one is by far the most important. Strangely however, few manufacturers today make a long  and  wide toaster any longer.  Braun is one of the few that does.  That fact combined with the great design is reason for me to give it a hearty recommendation

First, with the Waring, I made a frozen Island Oasis mix using ice, and the consistency was amazing.  

Second, since I'm single, I absolutely love the small size (I think it's like 24 oz or so).

Third, it's not really that loud.  I mean no louder than any other blender I've used.

Fourth, there are no cheap plastic parts!  Yay!  Only high quality parts. The jar is stainless steel. If the two top pieces are plastic or polycarbanate(?), they are of very high quality.  

Fifth, the blades are built into the stainless steel container, and it's a snap to clean.  Just add a cup of water, a few drops of cleaning liquid, run the blender for 30 seconds or so, rinse, dry and you're done!  Cuts my cleaning time down considerably. Moreover, there's no unscrewing and cheap plastic round things that always tear.  There is absolutely no way that you would have problems with a leaking jar.

Last, I didn't have any problems with a burning smell.  I am sticking with Waring products.  My mother has one (at least 32 years old), and it still works

	I love this pan.  As for cooking: This pan does a great job on steaks, burgers, chicken, whatever. Leaves really nice grill marks. The only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it.  I use a 16"" round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range.  This seems to work just find for me.

As for Cleaning:  I let it cool a little after cooking and pour some water (no soap!) into the bottom of the pan while it is just hot enough for the water to boil a little, and using a wooden spatula (only use wood in this pan), I scrape all the fond away (burnt tasty bits stuck to the pan) and pour into the sink.  I repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel.  I then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm. Takes about 2 minutes to do this.  I store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time. This pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since I live in an apartment and don't have access to a grill

57,"	Excellent for Large Portions
	I did not find a problem with the balance, as previously mentioned by another reviewer. The only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is, that if they are planning on tossing their food, they had better be strong because this unit is heavy! Other than that, it proves to be very useful for large portions. It heats quickly, heats evenly, holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir. Yes, it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides. The purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well. Now keep in mind, there isnt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top, flat top or coil range. True frying ala Asian style is done on an open flame!

61,"	Some Le Creuset Products need ""Seasoning.""
	Le Creuset's grills, woks, and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be ""Seasoned"" like tradiitonal cast iron. There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this. Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan, the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes. Let the pan cool, remove the oil with a paper towel, and repeat two or three times. A surface ""patina"" builds up that is quite non-stick. From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel. In the case of burned-on food, a brief soak in soapy water works well. As the pan is used the patina continues to build.  Le Creuset's omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick.  The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating.  I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan, and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating. This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations. The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats, stir fries, and other hardier preparations.  If you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems.

A short soaking in soapy water works well for burnt food. While the pan is being used, the patina continues to form. Le Creuset's omelette pans are equipped with non-stick silverstone if you like non-stick. The structured enamel works well and is more stable at higher temperatures than non-stick coating. I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan and three pans with that textured surface and find they work well after such seasoning. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan, which has a good non-stick coating. This pan is well suited for sensitive foods such as egg and pancake preparations. The structured pans are well suited for grilling meat, stirring fries and other harder preparations. If you use good scratch-resistant silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset fabric and apply a small amount of PAM or a little oil with a paper towel, you have no problems."

67,"	Excellent kettle, Excellent company
	I received this tea kettle as a replacement for a Nova teakettle (the former model) that I purchased in October 2005.

Part of the quality of a product is how the company stands behind it, and Breville is excellent in this area.  My former kettle developed a short in the on/off switch.  I notified the company by email, and I received an email response in 3 hours asking some questions and for more detail.  In 3 more hours, I received an email with a fed-x label.  They indicated they wanted to see the product, and they would either repair or replace it.  Within a week, I had this new model as a replacement, since they no longer make the Nova.

I then received a follow up phone call from Breville to make sure I got and liked the new product, which I do.  The warranty period for the new product starts again, so it has a full one year warranty.  I also asked about the switch, since I was concerned that this could be a problem, and they assured me that this is a problem they just don't have with the applicances.  The customer service rep indicated that in 10 years, he had seen about 6 of the type of problem I had.  It seems that a customer service rep that has worked for a company for 10 years also says something about the company.

88,"	I never knew what a difference it could make
	Had I known what a difference this would make with my cooking, I would have bought one a long time ago. Everything is faster, now, and everything I mix, from potatoes to icing, comes out smoother, too. 
There are a variety of things you can make with this mixer, and I use mine a lot. Perhaps not every single day, but almost. I bake bread with it every few days, and I decorate cakes for parties and special occasions on the side. My mixer has never let me down. In fact, I am buying an extra bowl just for convenience, too. 
Sometimes you do get a strange smell when you use it to whip something up. They even tell you in your mixer's manual to expect it and that it is normal. 
I've had mine for almost a year, now, and was waiting until I had it awhile before I reviewed it. But I have yet to have any problems with it. 
It's cut preparation time more than half for everything I've made with it. From cakes to meatloaf and bread. It's sturdy and somewhat heavy, which means it's not going to easily be knocked off your counter. 
It does have a slow start to prevent flour from going all over. However, if you are using a lot of powdered sugar or flour to the point of it being more than half full, you will still want to use the stir speed until it's a little more settled and moist or you will end up with a mess. Not a big one, but a mess nonetheless. 
It comes with a book of recipes, but I've only used a few. I've never had any issues with it handling all the cookie dough and other heavy doughs I've mixed with it, however. In fact, I've made more cookies just since getting this than I did for years before. It's just so convenient and easy that I don't mind. I mean heavy doughs, too, like monster cookies and peanut butter m and m cookies, etc. 
I don't know what else to say about it. I don't think you will be disappointed in this purchase. I'm usually someone who doesn't like to spend a lot of money, but this was more than worth it, and I will be buying my daughter one someday, too

	The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. 

At this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer

	My old blender went kaput it was a kenmore. We decided to buy this blender since it also had a small food processor. 
The food processor has become our most frequently used tool. Preparing salsa, omlettes, indian food which requires vegetables chopped into small pieces, pancakes and numerous other tasks have become so easy that we make more vegetarian dishes now and they taste better since the pieces are well and evenly chopped.
Really enjoyed the blender during the summer months when we made fresh juices etc. Unlike the old kenmore one this one blends much better.

I recommend this to any one who does not want to spend money on an expensive food processor or does not have the counter space in the kitchen for all the apparatus that comes with a big food processor.
",1,"My old blender broke down, it was a Kenmore. We decided to use this blender because it also had a small food processor. The food processor has become our most widely used tool. Preparing salsa, omlettes, Indian food, where vegetables have to be cut into small pieces, pancakes and many other tasks have become so easy that we now prepare more vegetarian dishes and they taste better because the pieces are well and evenly chopped.

	This is a great shredder.  Absolutly the best out there.  It is a lousy slicer.  Take the bad with the good I guess.

My wife and I shred lots of cheese because pre-shredded cheese has chemicals added that change the taste and chemical properties of the cheese.   This attachment works wonderfully for cheese.   

A note on disassembly.  Some people have difficulty getting the cone off the plug (if you own one you know what I'm talking about).   The very easy way to remedy this is to remove the cone from the plug before removing the plug from the machine.  If you follow this one rule you will have very easy setup and take down.

	First, the good stuff: this peeler is sharp, requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable. I like having it, but I'm also holding on to my cheap little Oxo peeler for a couple of reasons: first, the Rosle produces very thick peels, which is a bit wasteful. Second, I tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me. The Rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right-handed and left-handed peeler. That said, I do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction, which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models

134,"	Perfect for slow roasting roasts until the meat falls off the bone
	Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products. These cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once. For this reason, one pan may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. 

Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat. Due to this efficiency, it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat.  Over heating may cause foods to stick to the pan, or worse burn and can cause the enamel to appear stained.  Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This helps your food stay warm while serving. The opposite holds true as well, chill the pan and it will retain its chill for a surprisingly long time.  Beware; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials. 

Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit contact to heat resistant plastic or wood utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain. 

The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the French oven, Cocotte or as it's also referred to, the Dutch oven specifically.  French ovens have been manufactured by Le Creuset for over 75 years, and were developed well before then.  In all this time the design has stayed constant, affirming the relevance of its cooking qualities.  These ovens come in either oval or round shapes.  The oval shape works well for roasting whole chickens and porkloin roasts, otherwise the differences are minimal.

This pan holds 6 3/4 quarts of food, measures 9 1/2 x 12 inches or 24 x 30 cm internal diameter, 4 3/4 inch or 11 1/2 cm deep, and weighs 13 pounds.  The domed lid provides a tight seal, trapping in moisture to roll back into the dish.  The lid may alternatively be used as a holding plate for chopped vegetables or meat during initial preparations.  Be sure to lift the pan off of cooking surfaces to reduce damaging either the pan or the surface.  French oven tends to do best if at least 3/4 full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot. 
 
French ovens were developed for slow cooking by stewing, braising or boiling.  Some typical dishes include roasts, and stews.  Other possibilities include gumbos, chili, dirty rice, baked beans, Swedish meatballs, osso bucco, or curing ice cream to name a few.

One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of. 

PROS: 
Efficient absorption and distribution of heat 
Hygienic enamel cooking surface 
Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors 
Cleans easily when not abused or misused 
Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table 
Easily lasts a lifetime 

CONS: 
Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 13 pound

	Le Creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron Chinese-styled wok.  It looks like a Chinese wok, and it is made of iron, but essentially it is not Chinese.

The wok is much thicker than a Chinese iron wok, and therefore takes much longer time to warm up. Some American users praised the wok by saying it does not need much fire, yet the essence of Chinese stir-frying is cooking through large fire: one heats a thin Chinese carbon iron wok with large fire, puts in vegetable or animal oil, and then does the entire stir frying in less than a few minutes.

Still, I liked the wok after purchasing it. The Chinese food here in the US usually is not really Chinese food in essence, but people like it. Why should I be so critial to a French cast iron wok which looks like a Chinese wok?

140,"	Cleans well and easy to use
	I've stir fried in this pan quite a few meals, including carmelizing onions with soy sauce. When used with medium heat, cleaning is very easy. Soaking it for a few minutes and then scrubbing with scotch bright for a minute works. I've done this also with high heat, it needed more scrubbing but after a few minutes it looked new. 

If you don't mind the extra scrubbing, as I don't, you'll be happy with a healthier alternative to non-stick pans. My experience shows that with a few minutes of scrubbing the advantages of nonstick can be matched even in the worst case scenario.

I'm a bit ambivalent about the size. I cook for myself and thought 9"" would suffice, but I didn't take into account the fact that I cook for 2-3 days at a time. This pan is a bit too small in that capacity. On the other hand, my stove top is tiny so it fits fine.

The handle is beautiful and well designed. I have no problem holding the pan even when full in one hand and it's well insulated. In contrast, I also own the Simply Calphalon sauce pan with a handle that's barely suitable for the weight. The quality of this pan is evident.

All in all, a very high quality product that will serve me for years

In a large, deep bowl, beat four fresh egg yolks on high speed and gradually add 2/3 cups sugar.  Slowly pour the hot cream into the yolks and sugar.  Mix in 1/2 cup of ground chocolate (Ghiardelli, for example).  Add melted chocolate and return to large pot.

There's an automatic shut off, the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold. It also come with a small spoon. Machine often come on by itself even before you hit the ""on"" button, probably if you hit the button before you plug it in. I would recommended that you have everything set up before hand.

The following products could be considered as tailored made for this device: Lipton Cup a Soup (sheer perfect for this machine), General Food International coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands. It also great for tea bags as well. I am not sure about brewing tea though.

187,"	Very convenient
	The only complaint from the other reviews that I can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control.  I certainly don't have any trouble getting hot milk.  My taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated, but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as I've had in America.

I've had my EspressoPro for 3 years and it's still working well.  When I first bought the machine, it didn't work, and the Capresso people were wonderful and immediately sent a new machine.  Then there was a mixup over the color (silver vs chrome), and again the Capresso people were wonderful and sent a new machine.  Both times they sent me a machine immediately, with packaging to send my old machine back, so I had a new machine within two days of calling them.

I always use Espressione coffee pods, and filtered water.  That's just what is most convenient for me.  I've never actually cleaned the machine's innards, and I haven't noticed any degradation in performance over the years.

The milk attachment is very convenient.  We wash ours about once a week, although we do have to wash the little siphon/nozzle thing every day.  It's about as much work as a stainless jug I guess, with the advantage that you're not wasting milk every time you make a latte.

The downside to the milk attachment is that I haven't found a way to get a lot of froth out of it.  It's got a little knob on top that is supposed to control the amount of froth.  It does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk, but no matter what I do, I almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte.  Occasionally I end up with a lot more or almost none, but I have no idea why.  That's my biggest complaint.

The bit where the coffee comes out into your cup (you can see my level of sophistication there) has two holes, so it can pour into two cups at once.  This is worthless.  The coffee never comes out evenly, and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway.  The end result of the two holes is that whenever I make an espresso, some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in.  It's also a bit short for any latte glass I've ever found, and you have to tilt the glass to get it under.

Despite the fact that the EspressoPro doesn't look particularly tough (it's mostly plastic, and not really heavy plastic at that), Mine is still going strong after three years.  Much to the dismay of my grandparents, three years is considered long enough to classify something as ""durable"" thesedays.

So there you go.  I'm sure there are machines that make better espresso, but for convenience, I haven't seen any machines that can touch this one for less than twice the price.  There are a couple of things I'd like to change (milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser), but I would still recommend it
",1,"Very practical The only complaint of the other reviews I can agree with is that the amount of milk foam is difficult to control. I certainly have no problem getting hot milk.

It does a good job of controlling the temperature of the foamed milk, but no matter what I do, I almost always have about 1 / 2 inch of foam on my latte."
188,"	Fantastic coffeemaker - if you have the space
	When my Braun FlavorSelect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working, I had to scramble to find a new machine. I wanted another Braun, but unfortunately, they seem to have stopped making a 12 cup coffee maker. So I had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features I wanted combined with good value. I finally found it with this Cuisinart model.

The advantages? For one, it makes excellent and HOT coffee. The carafe is solidly constructed and fits securely in square body so there's no chance of someone accidentally knocking it loose. Because the lid fits tightly, the pour is precisely narrow and smooth, with no side leaks even when the pot is full. The basket fits inside the housing instead of swinging free like so many models which prevents a misalignment between the water and the filter; the conical (Krups/Braun style) basket accepts both paper filters and gold-tone, although I learned the hard way that not all gold filters fit. The timer is very easy to program, as is the clock. The carafe warmer can be set at low, medium, or high for the temperature that's right for you. I found the ""high"" setting too hot since I drink my coffee black (I like my coffee hot but not scalding!), but those who add a lot of milk might appreciate it. The brewing is quick and efficient, with the process taking about a minute a cup, maybe less. The retro/stainless look complements most modern kitchen d cors. There's a 1-4 cup setting to make sure such small amounts stay hot, and you can select how long the warmer remains on. The pot beeps five times when brewing is complete and just before the warming plate shuts off. Parts are top rack dishwasher safe. It comes with a water filter system designed to improve the taste of the brew.

But the Cuisinart does have disadvantages. The water reservoir is located on the right side, in the back, which makes it a little challenging for lefties like me to dump the final bit of water inside even though the carafe pours very accurately. Although I haven't yet missed the opening, I do struggle briefly with those last few drops unless I use my right hand. The housing is fairly tall, so if your counter space is only under the cabinets, you may not be able to lift the top in its entirety. (This is when the small rear reservoir becomes a major issue as you have to have room to completely lift the rather large top toward the back.) Clearance required: 7.5"" wide by 8.5"" deep of counter space with no overhead obstruction to pull out for filling OR 21.5"" of overhead space to fully lift top. Without the top open, the coffee maker measures 7.5""w x 8.5""d x 14.25""h.

If you have the space for this coffee maker, you'll love it. I can't attest to how long it will last, but, as it comes with a three year warranty, I'm hoping for a good run

198,"	A great set at an even greater price
	I've used this set for several years now  and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives. Even though I also own Global and Shun kitchen knives, I find myself being drawn to the Insignia knives when I am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project. Although both the Global and the Shun have sharper edges, their price difference doesn't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get. That is to say, yes Global and Shun knives are sharper, but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that. 

Using my Insignia knives, I am able to quickly dice, cut, and slice through onions, carrots, chicken, roasts, etc. That said, there are several cavets that need to be stated. First, don't wash these knives in a dishwasher. It has nothing to do with the quality of the steel. I wouldn't wash my Ken Onion Shun Chef's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the Insignia. Second, these knives need to be honed regularly. A few strokes after every use makes a real difference. Third, after owning the knives for almost two years, I sharpened each of the knives on oil stones. These knives, like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time. The good news is that they resharpened quite nicely, a tribute to their quality. Since resharpening, they have continued to hold their edges. 

Last, the balance of these knives is more than adequate. I also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series. All though I am a bit of a knife snob, and although I would love to purchase a block set of either the Shun or the Globals, I can't justify it given that the Insignia's cut so well. My wife would really give me no end of grief if I threw out a perfectly good set of knives. And a good set of knives these are

199,"	Powerful, quiet, and well worth the price
	My living room (approx 12'x16' and open to the kitchen) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day. It sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it. The Bionaire BW2300 cools it in half the time it used to take.

~Edit: My statement that this fan cools my liviing room in half hte time I once did is inaccurate. If the outside temp is lower than inside, the fan cools the living room in just a couple of hours.~

It also does a great job circulating air when its hot out (and in) to keep the room from feeling stuffy. 

I have not experienced the temperature gauge problem that other reviewers have. The temp gauge on mine works well.

~Edit: The thermometer reads the temp of fan's exact location, not the room's temperature. For example, in the afternoon sun, mine consistently registers a much higher temp than the actual room tempature. When it is colder outside at night, it registers a slightly colder temp than the room temp. ~

Is it really quiet? Yes! I have a Vornado fan, which is quite quiet for a fan. This is even quieter (although not silent).

To accomodate different window sizes, this model comes with a built-in extender, and two add-on extenders. The fan with extenders isn't large enough to fit my 38.5"" window width. I could order another add-on extender from the manufacturer, but stuffed a wash cloth in the gap instead. 

What comes in the box? The fan, two extenders, two AAA batteries and the remote. 

~Edited 7/28/06:
I bought a second one for my bedroom. Its thermometer is completely inaccurate and overstates the temperature until the outside temp is about 75 degrees.

The slats which the air blows through are fixed on this model. So I cannot direct the air onto (or away from) a particular area of the room.

There's even a chance to choose which kind of tea you are brewing for optimal results (for example oolong or green).  This nifty little machine will do the rest.  It will even pour the tea in the tea pot!  I'm finally enjoying my fine tea without the stress.  It's almost like having a tea butler in my house!
",1,"My own tea butler! This machine is a great invention - especially for those of us who tend to spend on good tea and then screw up part of the process that falls between brewing and the first sip (for example, pulling the tea too long). I think my tea will have more chance of struggling with this new machine. The design is great - pretty classy, and I think it will be great for entertainment (I loved how the tray holding the machine could suddenly be transformed into a serving tray for the well-designed teapot and cups). This is how it worked for me: You pour the loose tea into the bucket, fill the tank with water, select the strength of the drink and switch it on. There is even the option to choose what type of tea you brew to achieve the best results (for example, oolong or green). This fine little device will do the rest.

	This tea pot, like their French-Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass' - it doesn't seem to break.  I'm hard on things and usually need heavy-duty models just for every day survival.  I've had this tea pot for - maybe 8 years - unheard of for things around me. The glass just doesn't seem to break.  Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea - a brilliant idea.  But here's the other cool thing: when you get a `presentation' tea like say a `peony' tea that opens into a flower or say, a sea-shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls' floating above it - you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does.

The ONLY down side is that the cap won't fit on the tea pot if you take the infuser out.  But I have never found that to be a problem.  The tea MAY cool a bit faster - but not so much so that it bothers me.  The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I've had speaks to it's wonder and durability.  Like I said, this is made of magic glass.

	Finding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to OXO.  I love their good grips products.  All the handles look great, but are also very comfortable and practical.  This strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people.  You can use this double rod strainer not only for straining, but also for sifting flour, draining, and if need be - awkwardly steaming veggies over boiling water.

It seems most people might go for the 8"" instead, but this one works perfectly for making gnocchi from scratch.  You have to make few enough in each batch that they can all rise to the top at once.  Then you scoop them all up with the strainer (the bigger strainer may be hard to fit in many pots).  Drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel.  Since you can do all this with one hand, you can use your other hand to grab more gnocchi to start a-boilin' quick as can be.

Whatever you use it for, this is a high quality strainer that will last

Today, I made soft serve!!!!!!  It isn't perfect but I'm well on my way.  I have been making the low fat version but I think the regualar version will be excellent. To make this machine work for you here are some pointers:
1.  If you don't have an upright or chest freezer, put the bowl in the back of your regular freezer.  
2.  Freeze the bowl for as long as possible beyond the suggested 12 hours.  
3.  You can forget the 12-15 minute check described in the manual.  You will not have a chance of having soft serv before a minimum of 25 minutes.  I mixed as long as 40 minutes.  
4.  SAVE YOUR RECEIPT.  Since the ice cream takes twice as long to mix as is suggested in the manual, you are using the motor 2x as much.  Therefore, you might have to use the 3 year warranty.

	Henckels Twin Signature 7-Piece Block Set is exactly what I'd hoped that it would be: a quality set of knives that is ideal for the home.

The set of Henckels that I've owned since the mid-80s finally gave in to a lot of use, sharpenings and dishwashings (dishwashing a good knife is a nice way to shorten the handle's life expectancy!). But 20 years of great service from my previous set of Henckels certainly warranted a loyal update/upgrade to another Henckels set.

And I am not disappointed. The new set is quite sturdy. Home users will be impressed with their strength; pros might be used to a higher standard, but I used to work in a professional kitchen and I can't see how these would not be as effective as anything a pro has. 

These knives come out of the box SHARP too...a lot sharper than the sharpest that I've ever had my previous set sharpened to. 

There were two descriptions from Amazon that tell you what you get; one of Amazon's descriptions included a carving knife (product description) and the other a peeling knife (what's in the box). Amazon seems to have corrected the error as of this updated 2-13-2006 writing. To be sure, here's what you actually get:

- 2 1/2"" peeling knife 
- 4"" paring knife
- 5"" serrated knife
- 8"" chef's knife...this baby cuts through a roast like a hot knife through butter even though it's designed for chopping and dicing. In my opinion, it's better than a carving knife.
- a sharpening steel
- kitchen shears 
- and a storage block with 11 slots which is great because some of the knives, especially the serrated knives, from my old set are still in mint shape (like the 8"" bread knife), so there's plenty of room in the block for knives in your current collection looking for a new place to sleep.

No 8"" carving knife. But like I said above, the 8"" chef's knife works better than any carving knife that I've used.

The only things missing from this set for the average home is a nice large bread knife (as I said this was not a problem for me) and steak knives (also not a problem as most households already have these). Plain and simple, this is a great set of food preparation knives that--if my previous set is any indication--will last for decades.

Bon Appetite.

258,"	A great, but expensive, addition to the kitchen
	The French-made Roul'pat, like its cousin the Silpat, is a flexible silicon mat enclosing a thin, fiberglass mesh for durability. The Roul'pat is designed for creating a non-skid work surface for rolling out and kneading dough. The tacky surface adheres to the counter without clinging to the dough, making it easier to roll out thin pastry crusts and the like. Because the mat is flexible, the transfer of a pie crust to pan is a cinch. Dipped chocolates don't stick, nor does fondant. At sixteen and a half inches by twenty-four, the surface is expansive enough for most recipes. The only drawback to this unusual mat is the inability to cut on it, ruling out anything that requires a cookie cutter or knife. The manufacturer also warns against folding and scraping the surface.

I find the Roul'pat works best on pie crusts, pizza dough, chocolate, and flatbreads (or any bread dough that requires rolling or shaping.) Clean up is simple - wipe with a damp sponge and rinse. Mild soap can be used if needed, although I try to keep the surface detergent free. (The Roul'pat is not dishwasher safe.)

This makes a fantastic gift for cooks who seem to have everything
",1,"A great but expensive addition to the kitchen, Roul'pat, made in France, is, like its cousin Silpat, a flexible silicone mat that encloses a thin fiberglass mesh to last for a long time. The roul'pat is designed to create a non-slip work surface for rolling and kneading dough. The sticky surface adheres to the counter without clinging to the dough, which makes it easier to roll out thin crusts of dough and the like. Since the mat is flexible, transferring a pie crust to a pan is child's play. Dipping chocolates don't stick, nor does fondant. With an area of 16 by 24 cm, the surface is large enough for most recipes. The only drawback of this unusual mat is the inability to cut it out, which excludes anything that requires a cookie cutter or knife. The manufacturer also warns against folding and scraping the surface. I think roul'pat works best on pie crusts, pizza dough, chocolate and flatbread (or on any bread dough that needs to be rolled or shaped). Cleaning up is easy - wipe off and rinse with a damp sponge. Mild soap can be used if necessary, although I try to keep the surface detergent free. (The roul'pat is not dishwasher safe.) This is a fantastic gift for chefs who seem to have it all"
259,"	Great grill pan!
	I've owned this grill pan for almost 2 years now and it does a great job of grilling everything from burgers to chicken, fish and thick steaks. It has the ability to heat up to a very high temperature, enabling me to nicely sear the outside of the meat. I can then pop the whole pan in the oven to finish cooking the inside of thick steaks or just to keep warm. As for clean up, the pan does need to sit and soak for a little while but after that, everything comes off with relative ease. No hard scrubbing involved. Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it

	I purchashed the Professional Series Tortilla Baker PS75791 to add healthy tortillas to my diet. I grind my own wheat berries and grow my oun yeast to make bread that is as fresh as it can be and is completed in 4 hours after grinding. A loaf cost just about 15 cents. I wanted to make freshly ground wheat tortillas for the cost savings and for the superior nutrition. I am very pleased with the results. I grind my wheat, but leave out the oil because I submurge my doe in olive oil so it will keep fresh for days in my frig and then work the oil into the doe just before pressing and cooking. The machine really works, and its easy to use. It a quality machine and is a mainstay of my healthy kitchen

281,"	Good Enough - and then some
	Purchased these to go with a 7 inch Henckels International santoku that I've been using for years, and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all Fine Edge cutlery is ""good enough.""  No, it isn't restaurant quality, and yes, if you put these through the dishwasher they'll tarnish and probably even start to rust (any metal designated as ""stainless"" is rust resistant rather than rust proof, and reviewers of other Henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably aren't treating their knives very well).  As a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking, but doesn't always have the time for it, these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality.  Be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening - I've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely - and should probably be hand-washed for longest life.  With that little bit of maintenance, however, this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs (it meets all of mine, but then I don't often dress poultry, filet my own fish, or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife) for quite a nice price

Other bonuses are that it is very easy to operate and has a thermostat so you can set it to the exact termerature that you want your room to be.

285,"	The best on the Market, Well I think it is.
	I have to say that I have tried almost all of the self-cleaning litter boxes out there for my Large Male 14year old cat.  He has the electric water fountain for kitties and yes he does drink lot and lots of water, so you know what that means, yes, he pees a lot.  Oh yea he is a larger (not fat) kitty so he eats a lot also, I aint sayin no more on that subject.

It has now been 25 AMAZING!!!!!! SCOOP/POOP/PEE CLUMP/URIN ODOR/POOP SMELL/LOTS  and  LOTS  and  LOTS OF ANOYING TRACKED SANDY LITTER .......................FREE DAYS!!!!!

This is not saying that this litter box does not have any room for improvement, but I am one happier kitty owner.  I will tell anyone that hates Doody  and  Pee Clump Duty, or that hates the tracked litter mess and nasty clumped up (metal or plastic) rake  and  plastic that never fits right storage container, get this litter box.

The main gripe I have with this litter box is the cost of the replacement crystal litter cartridges, but I have been told by numerous pet store owners and workers that there will probably be a generic competitor on the market soon which will hopefully bring the price of the litter cartridges down.  One can only hope!  But regardless, I am keeping this auto waste center for my cay.

The other gripe, but not major problem I have seen so far, is with the cardboard for the cartridge that the litter sits in.  Now my cat, with a regular clumping litter box had clumps the size of softballs.  After 25 days, there is, on the bottom of the inside tray, (not the bottom one that actually touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the thing out) a wet spot in the area that my cat likes to urinate at, apparently this is his favorite spot to pee.  On the bottom cardboard tray (the one that touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the cartridge out) there is just the hint of a wet spot.  I think that if they increase the wax content in the cardboard or if that is what is actually coating the cardboard this will help.

I have not had to realign the rake as other people have said they had to do.  I do not smell any urine or poop and there is a lot of shrunken poop under that cardboard tray cover.  I have minimal tracked crystal litter on the floor around and/or under the litter box.  The motor is not as quiet as I would like, but then again it doesn't bother me or wake anyone in my house up either, it is kept on a wooden floor right out side the bedroom door in a hallway.

If you are in the market for an almost maintenance free litter box for your cat, try this one.  Like I said earlier, it's not 100% perfect, but it is the best damn self cleaning, almost maintenance free litter box on the market.  Not every kitty or human for that matter poops and pees that same, so if you don't try it you will never know if it's right for you and your kitty/kitties.  Read all the rest of the reviews for this and other products and see what everyone is saying about all of them, make an educated decision

You have to use the stainless steel glass with warm, soapy water, put it under the spindle and then rotate it around to clean it.

We almost went with the All Clad, but we just couldn't get over how uncomfortable the handles were.

288,"	THE cookware for serious home cooks
	My fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us.  I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware.  This is exactly what the Dr. ordered!  Here's why:
1)  Heavy, sturdy construction.  These things can take a beating.  They heat evenly and hold heat very well.
2)  You can use metal utensils with them.  I hate plastic spatulas!  We all know that we aren't supposed to use metal with non-stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless, peeling shadow of its former self.  Well this isn't the case with Calphalon 1!  Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear.  
3)  They ""stick"" and sear as well as cast iron cookware (it's a good thing).  This is the best feature for me.  Coated non-stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that's not non-stick such as stainless steel or cast iron.  They ""stick"" for a reason.  You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning.  Now there's the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non-stick pan.  It's a no-brainer!  
4)  They look cool, have great handles, they're oven-safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty.  

These are not cheap.  If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don't buy this expensive set.  It will dissapoint you.  But, if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable, functional set, and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top-of-the-line product then this is for you.  Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware
",1,"THE cookware for serious hobby cooks My fiancé and I signed up for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us. I have been an enthusiastic home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete cookware. That is exactly what the Dr. ordered! Therefore: 1) Heavy, stable construction. These things can take a hit. They heat evenly and keep the heat very good. 2) You can use metal utensils with it. I hate plastic spatula! We all know that we should not use metal with non-stick pans, but we all do, and after a while our pan is a useless, flaking shadow of its former self. Well, that is not the case with Calphalon 1! Scrape away without fear with any device you have at your disposal. 3) They ""glue"" and fry ""and cast iron cookware (that's good). That's the best thing for me. Coated non-stick cookware has its place, but if you like to fry in the pan and get these tasty browned pieces for sauces, you used to have to use a non-stick pan, such as stainless steel or cast iron. They ""stick"" for a reason. You need that contact with the hob to get that great tan."

	I never really noticed the inner groove as a ""problem"" until I read the other reviews. This was part of my first All-Clad set--so nice! Yes, things stick in the groove, but I just use a silicone spatula while cooking and I don't seem to have a problem.  I love the capacity and size/shape of this unit. Scrambled eggs come out beautifully in this pot, as does chocolate ganache and buttercream frosting. But sometimes my pumpkin pie filling gets bits of cooked egg if I'm not diligent about stirring out the groove. The width/depth ratio allows me to really get my whisk or spatula inside to work. 

Sometimes the dishwasher (horrors, I know!) doesn't get the groove completely clean. I hand-wash it most times anyway, so that doesn't really matter too much to me.

I like the length of the handle, but I wish it were slightly thicker to make it easier to grab when using a pot-holder

Also, it should be noted that Bodum sells the spare parts for this press (right here on Amazon, in fact), so if you should break it, a few dollars will get you back in Java!  
Another note, some people have mentioned that dumping the grindings proves problematic as you can't just put them down the drain (plugs up your trap).  I have found an easy solution in using the plastic and wire mesh grind basket of my last automatic coffee maker as a strainer.  I just pour the bit of water and grinds out of the press and into the basket (which I leave in the sink), and allow the water to run off.  Then I pour shake the dry coffee into the trash.  No fuss, and the basket is dishwasher safe for the occasional cleaning

326,"	French Press Coffee -- Why take the time.
	For ideal coffee using a French press is the best method.  It takes a bit more time and effort, but results in much better tasting coffee.  This is because due to the lower temperatures and the lack of a paper filter the coffee oils stay in tact.  This adds a lot of flavor to the coffee that is lost otherwise.  
     As for this French press in particular: size does matter.  If you make enough coffee that you aren't drinking by the single mug then just get a bigger press.  I drink about a pot and half of coffee most week days and find the effort required to use this smaller press a hassle.  As such I just keep this press at home and only use it in the evenings.

	We love this thing.  The steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board.

With the steamer I just drag the wand and go, so far easy as pie.  On some types of fabrics or clothing details I can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial, but overall we love this thing.

329,"	Looks Good and Gets the Job Done
	All Coffee grinders leave a bit of a mess so don't let the comments about stray grinds deter you. 

All the reviewers who used flavored beans need to be discounted since that is not recommended.  Others seem to have trouble with the ""door"" which is really just a deflector for the grind. You get a few grinds on the counter but that is a small price to pay for delicious fresh coffee.

Th A-9 has a strong relatively quiet motor (which means it is still loud, but not as loud as most other burr grinders0 and takes up very little counter space. The glass hopper for the beans seals at the top with a scrw on lid.

I love the idea of the measuring cup which saves a lot of time scooping.
It eliminates that step...just grind until you have the right amount and dump it into your coffee basket.

331,"	I can finally make proper pancakes
	I'm glad I bought this griddle! I've been stuck with teflon-coated nonstick pans for a while, and when I saw such great deals on cast iron pans, I had to buy a few. I ordered the griddle, the ~10"" Logic grill pan, and the ~10"" skillet. Thankfully all three qualified for free Super Saver shipping, because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves! The order was placed late Monday night, and I was promised that my pans would ship by the following Monday. By Wednesday the griddle had arrived, and the grill pan showed up on Friday. Way to go, UPS! It turns out that its good to get these things early, because it takes a few days to get the ""natural finish"" pans properly seasoned. I think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly. Food won't stick to a cast iron pan if you've taken the time to season it until it's black and almost totally non-stick. It takes some time and paitence, but it's the same way with a good wok: you get out of it what you put into it, and this certainly reflects in one's cooking. Iif you're going to buy one of these pans, DO YOUR HOMEWORK! Ask Google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan. If you want to save some time, just buy the Logic line of pans, because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase (the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original). Keep in mind that you will eventually have to re-season the pan, but hopefully not for a while (we'll see how the grill pan turns out).

I agree with some of the other reviews, the handle could stand to be made a little longer. I am a pretty physically fit chef, and I still find the griddle to be pretty hefty. A little extra ease of carrying a heavy piece of what's usually very hot iron would be great. I've found that grabbing it with a folded cotton (natural fibers don't melt!) towl helps, or if you're serious about using cast iron (and you like to sear meat on it) you should invest in a pair of welder's gloves or something equally thick and heavy and fireproof.

This morning I pulled the griddle out of the oven where it had spent the past few days being alternately heated, rubbed down with peanut oil, and cooled; and I heated it up and made pancakes. You have not LIVED until you eat pancakes cooked on a hot cast iron surface. Teflon-coated pans simply cannot compare. I can't wait to try making grilled-cheese sandwiches, omelettes, and hashed browns on this griddle. With any luck, this will be the last griddle I ever need to buy (and hopefully the griddle my grandchildren won't have to buy)

	I learned a long time ago, if you go KitchenAid, you go for life. They make the highest quality, longest life products I have ever seen. This hand mixer is the third of its kind I've owned. I've had two of the Braun models and they died out after about a year of average use. I finally got the KitchenAid and it has been going strong for a few years now. I really like having the ability to go down to the bottom of a large pot, a full 8"". Even though it is of substantial weight, it fits your hand like a glove. I found it far superior to the Braun, as a matter of fact, it doesn't even compare.
The plastic cup with lid makes an excellent accessory since you can mix and store without wasting time. The chopper is the most efficient I have seen, does a better job that a food processor. I especially like the multi-speed dial. It goes from 1 to 9 so it has the power you need, when you need it. Egg white or whip cream doesn't even challenge it, the whipping attachment makes sure of that.  This baby  handles like a pro.

351,"	My favorite salad spinner
	This is my favorite salad spinner, and I've tried several over the last couple years.  It dries my lettuce very well, and has some useful features that I haven't seen in other spinners.

Like the old Zyliss spinner, you pull on a handle to spin the basket.  But with this one the more you pull, the faster it spins, kind of like revving up a top or something.   It spins much faster than those 'crank' spinners or the 'push down' type -and faster spinning means more water off your veggies.

As for the new features, here are my top five: 

1) The lid is clear, so you can see the veggies spinning around in there and make sure you're not overfilling the spinner, the lettuce isnt bunching up in one corner, etc. OK, it's also just mesmerizing to watch your food spin round and round.  Kind of like watching your clothes roll around in the dryer.

2) There is a brake! So after you've whipped  your veggies into a frenzy, you can slam them to a stop -which also helps get more water off.  This works better on the small sized spinner, since there is less weight to stop, but even on the big spinner it works very well.  I have seen a brake on another spinner, but this one works much better.

3) The cord pulls itself back in -and gently: I disliked how the old 'string' spinners would yank on your arm, and if you didn't respond just right the string wouldn't pull in at all: it ends up just sitting there in a pile.  You'd have to take the lid off and wind it up yourself!  This new design winds the cord up every time.

4) The basket is smooth on the inside -that's something I defintely have not seen before.  It's a subtle feature, but very helpful: it helps make sure little bits of your lettuce dont get stuck in the basket when you're cleaning it out.

5) You can stack things on top of it, both in the fridge and in the cupboard, because the top is mostly flat.  The handle even sits in its own little pocket in the lid so that it's not in the way.  In my house fridge space is valuable and I appreciate being able to stack this spinner like I do with my tupperware.

So, overall I am impressed with this spinner (so impressed that I've also given it as a gift!).  It does its job very well and has thoughtful extra features which make it more helpful around the kitchen

354,"	So why did I absolutely love this pan?
	Well, ""um"" My dad has my first Calphalon pan. He stole it from me. ha, ha...He loves it to cook my mom breakfast. 

So, I needed a new one. 

This pan has a triple-coated nonstick interior - nothing sticks, it just slips around. 

Trust me, this is important when frying eggs. 

There is also a certain sound that seems to be unique to these pans. The food not only cooks well, it sounds good while it is cooking. Yeah, that sounds strange, but you will see what I mean. These pans just have a touch of class to them that is unequalled. 

The tri-ply stainless construction includes an aluminum core. It is meticulously crafted and the pan sits flat and doesn't move, even on the flat cooktops. The heat distribution is great. 

Flared Rim and sloped sides perfect for omelets or saut ing 
Stay Cool Handle - very impressive, didn't even get warm
100% dishwasher safe

This pan is also oven safe to 450 degrees, however they don't recommend you use this for broiler use as it will damage the nonstick surface of the pan. 

I was skeptical because on a flat cooking surface, many pans will actually start spinning. This pan just sat there and that was impressive. 

The base is completely flat and that is the beauty. You would be amazed at how many pans are not completely flat. 

Covered by a lifetime Warranty so they will repair or replace any item that is found to be defective. 

The Nonstick Calphalon Cookware is a real favorite for frying because nothing sticks! 

Made this cook smile!

356,"	Excellent product for whole grain bread and muffins
	If you like to bake this is a nice product to have in your arsenal of tools.  I bake whole grain muffins and breads every week and find this pan to be extremely useful.  

The breads that I have made released easily after they had cooled.  I find it best to place this pan on a cooling rack for about an hour before removing the bread from the pans.  If you do this it releases completely.  If the bread is still warm when you try to remove it, it might not come out in one piece.

I have found that it is best to put this pan on a half sheet pan prior to filling it with dough or batter.  If you try to carry it to the oven without a pan underneath it, it is not very steady.

If you don't have other silicone bakeware you are unfamiliar with the nicest feature of this product.  You can squish it up in a ball to store it, and bounces back to its original shape when you need it.

My only complaint about this pan is that the bread does not brown as well on the bottom as sides as it does in a metal pan.  But, being able to make 6 medium sized loaves at one time more than makes up for decrease in browning.

358,"	Nice for small batches of sauces
	Worked very well when whipping up a roux. The heavy disc bottom did a good job of evenly distributing heat and didn't scorch. The rounded sides meant that I had no problem getting a whisk into the sides of the pan. Cleaned up easily and looks really nice. Whoever designed this stuff got the shape and materials right; it is very aesthetically pleasing.

The main downside is that at 1 quart, it is not as useful if you need to cook for more than 2-4 people.

Note to the person who had the pan discolor: simply sprinkle a little bit of ""Barkeeper's Friend"" in the pan and rub with a damp sponge. I find this cleaner shines up all my stainless steel to like-new condition with no scrubbing or scratching. It also works to keep the copper banding looking shiny

	*****
I bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something---like a little yogurt, or some granola, some fresh raspberries---and we use them all the time.  I agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep.

They are not thin, as a previous reviewer has noted.  They are not thick or bulky either, though, just perfect.  They seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well.  They almost look, well...elegant, which seems kind of cool for just Pyrex and for the price.  

The bowls come well-packaged, and although the price is very low, they definitely don't seem cheaply made.  I haven't seen them in stores, either.  Great buy!

363,"	Nearly Perfect
	Lots of reviews already, so let's not waste your time:

Pros:
- easy to setup (no waiting for charcoal or having to buy propane)
- easy to clean
- practical. U can use it indoor/outdoor
- No flames, so it's quite hard to actually burn the food

Cons:
- Doesn't cook the food 100% evenly. Noticed that the area around the thermostat is hotter. Not by much though, but you can notice the grill marks on the food stronger when near the thermostat
- Doesn't get really really hot. If you're trying to cook Brazilian style (large chunk of meat), it might not work out. However, it's great if you cut it into smaller chunks of meat.

Overall:
I love this so much that some days I use this for lunch and for dinner. There are no pans to clean. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's not even throughout the whole plate.

	Had this on my Amazon wish list, but then came across it for the same price at a Target store and bought it (sorry Amazon). And I really am pleased so far. My toddler has allergies and his allergist had recommended an air purifier for his room. We did lots of research in looking for the right one that was still affordable. I really like that this one has washable filters. Lots of $$$ savings there. Since getting this, my son has had fewer runny noses and no severe allergy symptons. We've even been able to drop two of his three allergy meds - - not sure yet though if this is due to the seasons, or perhaps we were possibly over-medicating him before, or if this thing really does work that kind of miracle. Either way, fewer snotty noses makes me happy. In regard to the concerns over noise, this one is fairly quiet. I keep it on low pretty much all the time and it is hardly noticeable. My son has no problem sleeping with it running in the same room. The oscillating feature is nice and it has a small nightlight on it that comes in handy. I would definitely recommend the Honeywell HFD 120.

	I bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price.  I expected it to get me through that winter only.  I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years, heat in fall/winter and fan in summer.  It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter.  The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on/off/heat control wheel is starting to become loose.  Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated.  The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on/off more or less appropriately.  I'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough.  I just bought two more, my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails.

But even doing that extra step is simple after 30 min's of churning.  Soft ice cream DEFINATELY never takes longer than 45, usually 37-40, and hard is about 45-48 min.

This error caused me no problem during the assembly. The intention was clear to me. The look is good. It looks a little clunky to get an excellent rating from me.

	We've gotten into homemade custard-based ice cream and that means careful stirring to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. The design of the working end of the whisk allows the head to reach every bit of the pot but without my having to twist my stirring arm into a knot. Since the head is hinged, it lies flat in a drawer which is a good thing, too

	I love this tea kettle.  It not only looks great but is of heavy duty construction unlike those $10 aluminum throw-aways.  Since I am only an occasional tea drinker, I tend to leave water in the kettle and move it to hot burners when cooling (I have cast iron elements/electric oven so burners stay hot for awhile after use).  Other tea kettles create rusty water, since water remains in the kettle.  Not this one!  It boils water rapidly and is great looking on the stove.  My handle does not get hot and, like I said, I have cast iron elements which really heat up and remain hot.  I do agree that you cannot take the whistle off without an oven mit.  That's the only flaw; they should have made the whistle heat resistant like the handle

396,"	I love this pan
	I Love this pan and Size.
 I wasn't going to buy this pan at first, cause it was the ""Simply"", But I'm not sorry at all...

  I have alot of Calphalon Commercial (at least 20), and yes it's thicker, But I think this cooks very well.
 Being that this is abit lighter, I find when its filled up, its heavy enough for me, and easyier to handle.
 The price is also alot less then the Calphalon Commercial.
Since you most likely would not use this pan everyday, I would think you would not need a lifetime warentee like the Commercial gives you , if you use it the right way.

  I have sauted hamburger meat,onions, peppers ect. emptyed the fat off, added sauses, and continued cooking everything together, then puting this into the oven to finish it off..
Never a problem.

  I have used this for making Large Egg Omelets, the cheese has never stuck.
 Use it for fryed potatoes with low fat cheese, and I don't need to use alot of oil,
The nonstick works fine.
 I have used this for sauteing Pasta with sauses..
 
 This is a large size, so you can put alot into this and have left overs.
 You can make pancakes, frenched toast, I would think anything you want..
I guess what I'm saying is, you can use this size for anything.
 
   I do have the Calphalon Commercial double gridle, but if you don't have room for all the peices that I have, this can cover alot.
 I have found this to cook even, and you don't need to turn your stove on high.

 This lid seems to fit fine, and its a bit domed. I don't have a problem with it.
The sides are stright up, and seems high enough.
Lots of flat space in the bottom.

  Mine is also made in Ohio, not Japan, but you never know with some peices of Calphalon lately!!
 
  This washes very easy.
Never put any Calphalon into the dishwasher, altho this lid you could put into the dishwasher ( I don't tho)

 I would buy this again...I only paid $42.00 for this, so I did buy two of them, one for a gift.
 I don't understand Amazon's priceing , as sometimes the Calphalon Commercial can be less money!!
So I would say, take the time and check out your other options, as the Calphalon Commercial has more layers of nonstick and is a higher quality, but don't let that scare you off from buying this one

	This is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased (actually I purchased the extra coarse version), but the only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5* rating to. The other grater was from the standard line not the professional line. With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters!

All Microplane graters use the same basic technology for cutting -- technology which was originally developed for the woodworking industry but that has adapted for exceptional service in the kitchen as well. The razor sharp laser cut grating head will make quick  and  easy work of cheese grating or citrus zesting (if you have the proper size). I would suggest when choosing a size of grater that you choose 1 size larger as the sizing tends to run on the small size.

Now, what makes the professional so much better? Well, the standard line has 3 major/minor flaws: 1) the easy-grip rubber handle tends to capture water when washed, 2) the plastic molded frame holding the grating surface cracks when washed in the dishwasher,  and  3) the head is so incredibly sharp that it must be kept covered, yet there is no easy way to due this except for the original tagboard cover.

The professional version fixes all of these issues. As you can see, the frame and handle are all stainless steel which eliminates issues #1  and  #2 and the professional version comes with a nice snap-on plastic cover to protect the sharp head surface.  In addition, the rubberized rest on the top of this version can come in very handy.

End result: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

But I've been using it for a while and I've enjoyed it a lot. From soft to crispy in a short time, easy to use and clean. My only complaint is that it's quite big for the size of my kitchen. Superb waffles! Thick and golden, as in the photos submitted by users. I've never had such good waffles, not even in a restaurant. True Belgian waffle recipes may require a little patience and know-how, but they are worth the effort. I have read some complaints about the timing mechanism, but I find that it is largely flawed. The money is worth it"
418,"	We Love This!
	Ok...the only thing domestic about me is that I live in a house.  Cooking is a necessary evil.  This waffle maker is the best!  We love staying at hotels w/breakfast bars just so we can use the waffle makers!  Two things I have noticed about this appliance...I have 3 kids and a husband that all love the waffles, so when we use it I am making a lot of waffles.  If it starts to appear the waffles are getting more crisp, dial down the heat setting one less than what you are currently set on.  We start out with a ""4"" setting.  I am in the habit of spritzing the grids EVERY time we bake a waffle.  If you miss between, the waffles don't stick, but it is apparent they don't slip right out as easy.  I have found that a butter flavored cooking spray gives the waffle more of a ""restaurant"" taste.  We use the box batters...there is no way in hell I would take the time to make the book mix...LOL.  I've used more expensive mixes to store brand mixes ($1.99/box) and they all bake up great.  

My mom has the same unit and she pretty much echos everything I have said.  They will make extras and freeze them.  We never have extras at our house--LOL!

I have decided to keep my waffler out on the counter, it looks very sleek next to my beautiful staninless Kitchenaid mixer, stainless rice cooker and stainless coffee maker.  And, I admit it, I throw all the mix into the mixer and let the mixer do the job for me.  

Clean up is a snap and we have enjoyed having this appliance.  BE SURE TO HAND WASH THE BATTER CUP if you don't want the writing to come off.  I have scratched mine with an ice pick to show the proper level.  Also, I have a small spatula on hand I use to spread the thicker mixes around (quickly) if need be.  I also hand wash the tray and just let air dry and wipe up the unit after each use.

I just can't justify taking the entire family out to breakfast for $30-40 when we can make all the goodies at home.  We are also planning a suprise waffle bake for my son's teacher at school for his birthday with my waffler.  I will just pre-mix a ton of batter.

We have a family friend who we owe a belated wedding gift to and this is what we are going to get them.  I know they will enjoy it too.

Happy cooking

Keep in mind that these are NOT the heavy Stainless Steel, but the lighter weight ALUMINUM. You will NOT be able to mistreat
these pans by turning the flame up on full. To do so will cause
the pans to warp.

426,"	engineer, not a baker
	I bought one of these muffin pans because I was excited at the prospect of owning a piece of bakeware whose lining wasn't destroyed by the 3rd time I wanted to use it. For that alone, I would give this item 5 stars.

I am not an experienced baker, but I think that after reading the other review for this item that more balanced comments need to be stated regarding the actual use of this muffin pan.

So here are my comments:

1. You need to use a cookie sheet (or something similar) to support the pan since it is flexible.

2. The muffins cook faster than with a metal pan.

3. The muffins seem small if you fill the cups as you would with a metal muffin pan - you can actually fill them up all the way. (Recall that I am not an experienced baker; as an engineer I suspect that since the muffins cook differently, i.e. faster, this could be compensated by adjusting the batter in some manner. As far I'm concerned as long as the muffins taste good, it doesn't matter to me.)

4. The coating is not exactly non-stick. You do not need to grease the pan, but you do need to be careful when it comes time to remove the muffins. I use the dull side of table knife to separate the muffin sides from the pan (while gently pulling the pan). After doing that I put a plate on top of the muffin pan and  hold it against the pan as I invert the pan. All I have to do then is tap the bottoms of the muffin cups to get them out. By my third time doing this I was able to get them all out intact and unscathed.

I am very happy with my muffin pan - it might take a little bit of getting used to for someone used to other pans - but for me, the benefit of not having a cheap non-stick coating peeling off of the metal after a year more than compensates for a slight learning curve on the use

429,"	Squeezes out the competition
	I bought the Omega 8002 Juicer on the recommendation of Dr. Joseph Mercola, a holistic health MD who has a popular newsletter and website. We met him at a health fair, tried vegetable juices (including wheatgrass juice) and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet. I mean, how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day? Not so much. 

The Omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 RPMs, a powerful, slow auger that doesn't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam. This protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation. In addition, it is ""multifunctional""--the juicer can also be employed to make baby food, meat pate, nut butter, or fine ground coffee. The machine is durable, said to be quiet, and has a 10-year guarantee. Sounds good, so we plunked down the cash and got the Omega juicer and set to work. 

So, how is it to USE the Omega? Well, it's EASY to put together, though there are quite a few parts and choices to make. Essentially, the steps are:

1. Install the screw drive--the big green plastic spiral, into the plastic housing.
2. Pop a juicing cone (a type of sieve) over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw. This takes a bit of jockeying, but it drops in just fine. 
3. Screw on the end cap and nozzle.
4. Mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor.
5. Add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing.
6. Put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing; one for the pulp, one for the juice.

Now it's ready to start juicing.  
 
1. Cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube. This means if you juice carrots, those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise. 

2. Turn on the motor: it has a forward direction to drive the food OUT, and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog. I've never needed to do this.

3. Push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer. The food feeds along the screw, is broken up, and the juice is forced through the sieve (cone.) Out the nozzle comes the pulp. The juice flows out underneath, nearer to the motor. 

4. When you are finished, turn off the motor, which is QUITE quiet--nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner. More like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor, for comparison. Dismantle the machine and wash the parts. A big bottle brush is included for this, very helpful.

5. Cleanup takes about 2-3 minutes and is mainly rinsing. The worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that doesn't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it. I do this ASAP, as I sip my juice, because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean. I then reassemble it right then and there, and it's ready to go again.

The Omega juices kale, which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage.  We now can do wheatgrass, once we grow some or find a source of flats of it. 

Just for grins, I tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding. It makes a fine grind--not something you'd use for hamburger. It would work for soft, somewhat grainy baby food or pate. I did not try making pasta. 

How does it compare to spinning cup type models, like the Braun which we previously used for juicing?

1. The spinning cup model (Braun) is LOUD, really loud. This is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result. This is typical for the cup-type juicer. Sounds like a blender.  

2. The cup model cannot juice wheatgrass--the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants. It also can't do tough leafy vegetables such as kale.

3. The cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the Omega. The pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry. The pulp from the Omega, by contrast, is like slightly moistened sawdust--definitely drier.

In summary, the Omega juicer, while pricier than the typical spinning cup models, is quiet and effective. It gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup can't handle, like wheatgrass and if you want, meat. It extracts more juice--and at the prices for produce these days, especially if you buy organic produce, this is an important benefit. The juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use. If you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods, I would say, this is a model to strongly consider over others. The performance and added functionality well repay the higher price

432,"	One of my 3 CAN'T DO WITHOUT kitchen items!!!
	I've had 2 sets of these simple but marvelous mats so far, not only the handiest thing I've bought for my kitchen, but friends keep talking me into giving them one. I only need one or two but one is always on my countertop for various uses the past few years.

I'm a senior lady and disabled, and my time standing in the kitchen is limited so I hate cleaning up messes, picking up dropped stuff on the floor, sterilizing unweildy wood or plastic cutting boards. Mainly love the ease of chopping or slicing vegies on it, folding it over like a funnel and dumping right into a salad bowl or a pan with NO SPILLS, or vegies onto another can't do without item, faithful George Foreman Grill, beside my meat entree. Top down, vegies and meat dinner in 4 minutes.

So simple to just put under the faucet and run hot water over it, or wipe with a little bleach on a sponge. Very few knife marks on mine, but I don't like super sharp knives, and if I seldom have to cut meat I use a scissors and wax paper on the mat to then wrap and freeze pieces. I buy boneless skinless chicken or pork or sirloin chops. The grill gets a once over with a damp paper towel. So simple and time saver, not like cuts on a wooden board which is most unsanitary. 

Beyond a slicing surface, great for placing cannisters on to fill with coffee or sugar, salt shakers, or stuff I seem to always have to spill some, shakey hands at 70. Just roll it up, shake in the trash or sink disposal, rinse if necessary and reuse, keeps counter clean and free of stains. I put hot or cold things on it to protect the formica, made a few stains with coffee but cleans with bleach ok, not ruining my counter top. They wear well but at the price, and the work they save they can be tossed for another new one. Best features are flexible enough to roll and empty, easy cleanup forget the broom, and no storage problem in my cramped space - stack them on the counter and peel top one off for next job.

Besides these mats and the elec non stick grill, my micro rice steamer is the third CDW to make food preparation easier than ever in my life. If I spill dry rice filling it, roll and dump in the cooker. I am not kitchen friendly, want to spend as little time on my feet as possible, hate to cook, hate cleaning up, dinner in 6 minutes and I'm done. 

So glad to see these are on the web, had a hard time finding more in stores when I want to gift someone. If you want the job done clean and fast, tired of bending picking up rollaway strays off the floor (or always between stove and counter narrow space) buy these for a staple in a kitchen, especially for seniors - I've no dishwasher nor disposal I might add. Why in the world would one need a cutting board heat resistant? not for oven or stovetop use. For glue guns and crafts which I also do, put a piece of wax paper over your extra mat if you want to protect a table top, I use one on my desk and serves as a coaster too. I didn't even know about the silicone part, who cares. 

Just can't rave enough over these. Saves work, saves time

The beauty is that it really retains the heat and cooks the food thoroughly and evenly. The disadvantage is that it can take a while to heat up, especially since it should be heated at a low level to prevent items from burning and / or damaging the porcelain. I learned this the hard way by turning my soup to med-hi to make it boil faster (doh!). Now that we know how to use this type of cookware properly, we enjoy it even more! Another clever use of this piece is to incorporate it into your weightlifting routine (did I mention that this thing is very heavy?). After trying out the largest pots, we have started collecting some of the smaller pots and really enjoying them"

It's not much louder than most microwave ovens and it's far less likely to burn the popcorn. Only one minor complaint: butter doesn't really melt completely in the cup on top (make sure you have melted butter ready to go if you want it).

	I am so in love with my new machine.  Many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality.  I received my machine really quickly and that's saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification.  Speaking of gratification, I could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine.  All the reviews are true. It's perfect, once you read the instructions or perhaps do as I did, get a walk-thru from the wonderful folks at DeLonghi customer support, you will be up and running in no time.  You can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care (read the instructions) will last a very long time.  The espressos I've made so far are supreme, even my 14 year old loved a weak one I made for him; and it's so easy after set-up to use.  It could not be any simpler.  Who would not love this machine?  There was one website that was charging $1200 for the same machine.  I could not believe my eyes.  The only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine.  I really could not see what he was talking about.  It has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam (it makes very creamy foam) it will increase the volume 2-3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk.  But there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother.  They had me worried when I read that but the frother does its thing with total ease.  Even a caveman could do it.  You stick it in the milk and turn the switch and, voila!, it's frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and can't accomodate the foam it creates.  All in All, this is a top notch buy and a guilty pleasure for sure and nothing could be more gratifying then having merchandise that lives up to its promise.  This machine delivers, I love it and so will you

	This tabletop fan is a telling reason why Vornado has been around for a long time.

My wife uses this fan to cool off in the bathroom while getting ready in the morning, and it really does the job.  It has a very focused air flow so she can aim it on herself without bothering me.  It's very smooth running, so there's no danger of it vibrating off the counter.  It costs a bit more than the typical portable fan, but then there's nothing more frustrating than having a fan that won't cool you off.  No worries with this one!

Just a note on its construction: the difference between the chrome versions and the ABS plastic version is more than just the finish or a metal skin. The chrome versions have a ""zinc die-cast housing,"" weigh almost twice as much as the ABS plastic version, and are very stable.

Also, as usual, Amazon has inflated the price to make it seem like they're offering us a bargain when they're not. The list price on the manufacturer's website is $139.99, not $190. I got mine locally at Sur la Table

477,"	The Best Carpet Cleaner I have Ever Used
	I wanted to say that this is the Best Cleaner out there as far as Im concerned.
Very Easy to Assemble, and Use. Our carpet came out looking like new, all the stains that I have been trying to get out came out with no problem at all.
We bought a model home for custom built homes and there was alot of heavy traffic (foot) in the house not to mention we have pets in the house.
I used the cleaner all through the house (2200 sq ft). It was amaing how this cleaner got everything thing clean.

There was a large bad stain area due to a plate of hot food was dropped and all the oils from the cooking and butter was dumped on the carpet. I tried everything to remove it, nothing would get the stains out. When I used this Steam Cleaner on it, Guess What all the stains had been removed.

I really do think it has something to do with the brush action and the fact that it heats up the water, plus it also gives out equal amount of soap and water.

I would also add that I have used this on our furniture and it worked just as good as it did one the carpet 
I have recommended this machine to all my friends, it is worth the money Plus.

I also have a small Steam Cleaner from the same company it is perfect for the Rec Room and pet accidents on the carpet

482,"	Pretty,Stylish,Scratches and Chips
	To prevent scratches and chipping and to retain Fiesta's smooth glossy surface, hand wash separately, one piece at a time, in a soft rubber dishpan and stack between paperplates (cups between coffee filters).  I do this with all my stoneware and pieces 30 years old still look like new. A friend gave me all her brown dripware (Gourmet) from 1969 and the place settings are scratched, pitted and dull from stacking and years of automatic dishwashing.  Mine from the same era are still glossy, mostly scratch free, and certainly not pitted. Also, I don't put my original pieces in my microwave, (only hers) because although it may be safe to do so, this can dull a glossy finish.  Re Fiestaware, I remember seeing relatives and neighbors Fiesta cups  and  plates with chips and always thought them very unattractive and ""cheap""- looking, perhaps because of the dull rose, gray, and avacado colors at the time. However,I find most of the colors presently available very bright and pretty and,so far, have bought Heather,Seamist, Scarlett, Tangerine, Turquoise, and yellow. Cobalt, Cinnebar, and Plum are just too dark and dreary for me.  In the store, they are much darker than they look on here. In a library book on fiestaware, they show an earlier cobalt or deep blue color that is very pretty and a real plum color (like the fruit) would be bright/pretty, too.

485,"	Great knife for the price
	I received this knife as a Christmas present and so far, I am pleased. What struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is. I also own a Wusthoff Santoku (which I love, too) and this knife was just as sharp right out of the box as the Wusthoff was. It is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action, which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables. It is also wonderful for carving meats, with its long sharp blade. The blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes, however, but is certainly functional. The grip is also slightly larger than I would like, making it a bit more cumbersome to hold than my Wusthoff. But these matters are not that important considering the price of this knife. If price were not an issue and I had to choose between a Wusthoff and a Forschner Fibrox, then I would probably choose a Wusthoff. But being that a Wusthoff of this size would be at least $50 more, then price does come to play. If money is no object, then choose the wonderful German steel of a Wusthoff or look into the Japanese steel of a Shun. But if you are like most of us and have to consider price, then I do believe you will be happy with a Forschner Fibrox Chef's Knife.

488,"	A very efficient and durable filter to keep your fish healthy
	I've used a pair of Emperor 400 filters on a 75 gallon tank continuously for the past five years or so. So far, neither has needed attention other than filter changes and recently, new impellers. After five years, the constantly spinning impellers had worn their shafts and bushings to the point where they made a rattley noise, although they still moved water effectively. Replacing the impellers was an easy repair, and restored the unit to almost total silence. The filter may actually now be quieter than when it was new, as there appeared to be a slight design change in the new impellers when compared to the old ones. 

I'm still using the original biowheels, with no end in sight. For almost anyone, a single Emperor would provide adequate filtration, however at the time I purchased them, I had seven huge goldfish in the tank, who produced vast quantities of waste matter. Eventually the goldfish grew too large for the tank and were relocated to a pond in the backyard, and the tank was restocked with a variety of colorful tropical fish.

 The big selling feature for the Emperor 400 is the dual biowheels, which provides a highly oxygenated living space for beneficial bacteria to colonize. These bacteria help remove some of the waste products which the fish produce, resulting in healthier fish, and extending the time interval between water changes, and thus reducing maintainence of the aquarium. Other filters have alternative methods of providing biological filtration, but the biowheel is so effective that it can keep nitrates at an undetectable level.

 These filters are made of a black, slightly flexible plastic which seems to be less brittle than the transparant material used on some other filters. As others have mentioned, each filter has four slots for filter cartridges. And the filter comes with two refillable media containers which can occupy two of those slots, if you choose to use them. Then can hold extra carbon, zeolite, or other material. I have mine filled with porous ceramic noodles.

 The Emperor 400 has a control for water volume, so you can turn it down when feeding your fish, preventing all the food from being sucked into the filter. After the fish have finished eating, the volume can be set back to ""high"", however I have left it in the second slowest postion for weeks at a time, and the fish seemed to be content. I have found that if the volume control is not moved for a long time, it tends to accumulate mineral deposits and become stiff. So, I turn it down every day when feeding, then turn it back up a couple of hours later. Also, if the power is interrupted while water volume is turned down, the filter takes longer to prime itself and begin pumping properly. If power fails when volume is turned up, the filter restarts with no problem when power is restored.  

 The Emperor 400 comes with a cleaning brush for the spray bars and an extension for the water intake to be used if you have a very deep tank. My own tank is fairly deep, and the extension would bring the intake nearer the bottom, however I don't use the extension, and filtration seem fine.

 When setting up an aquarium, it should be born in mind that the closer to a natural habitat you can get, the healthier your fish will be and the less maintainence will be required. My own tank is set up as follows:

 Two inches of ""Eco-Complete planted aquarium substrate"" soil purchased in sealed bags at the local store AquariumConnection. The soil is intended for use in aquariums with live plants, which feed on some of the wastes. In the soil, there are approximately 20 Anubis plants scattered around the tank. The fish love to swim between and around the leaves, or hide behind them. From time to time, eggs are laid on the leaves of the plants. The bright green leaves stand out in vivid contrast against the nearly black soil. Two 15 watt fluorescent lights provide illumination to stimulate photsynthesis in the plants.

 I strongly recommend that you do NOT use any type of gravel, colored or otherwise, as food falls down into the gravel where fish cannot reach it, and where it rots and fouls the water. If you choose to use gravel, you MUST vacuum the gravel on a weekly basis, and your water still will not be as clean. Gravel equals more work and dirtier water. Sand is better than gravel as food cannot fall down into the sand, but sand still doesn't provide nutrition for live plants. Use Eco-Complete soil or something comparable, both you and your fish will be happier. 

 I also recommend that you do NOT use any type of undergravel filter, as these will also require frequent vacuuming, and eventual dismantling of the tank to clean beneath the filter plate. With the Emperor, you won't need additional filters. And again, undergravel filters equal more work and lower water quality. I NEVER vacuum the soil, and perform a 20% water change every couple of months, usually when I change filter cartridges. 

 The fish themselves consist of a number of cory catfish, who snuffle around through the soil and pick up whatever falls from above. There are as well golden tetras, cardinal tetras, redline tetras, silver dollars, danios, flying clouds, and mollies, and one otocinclus catfish. Some of the cory catfish are grandfathers several times over, and have grown to a large size in the five years or so they have lived in this tank.

 I feed them once each day, around 6:00 pm. Supper consists of several spirulina wafers, plus a pinch of flake food about the size of a nickle, which I crush between my fingers to produce many very fine particles.

 To sum up, the Emperor 400 is an efficient and durable filter which will help provide good water quality and healthy fish.

499,"	I feel like a star, now!!!!
	I ordered one of these, after seeing someone use a similar grill pan on a cooking show.  When I received the product, it was superior in quality.  Very heavy and extremely attractive.  I couldn't wait to use it.  I just wanted to get those little grill marks on my food, because I don't own an outdoor grill and I don't like the idea of dealing with mosquitos while grilling outside.  Not only did I get the marks, but I got the burnt grill flavor on my chicken breast, too.   The first night that I used it, I was having a dinner party while cooking.  It performed stellar on the first use.  I used chicken breast strips and noticed that though they seared with that great sound, they were cooking evenly and slowly.  The food didn't burn, but I had to cook it a long time to get the chicken thoroughly done.  The taste was perfect and not burnt or dry at all.  I was so excited that I cooked whole bonely breast two days later and can't wait to grill the shrimp and vegetables this weekend.  Beware though, the thickness of the meat will cause a lengthy grilling time.  So, the house will be full of smoke (for the inexperienced cook like me), but the meat will not burn or dry out.  I also purchased the heart shape pot which was great for display of the casserole but the grill pan has me walking on cloud nine.  Matter of fact, I'm eating grilled chicken for lunch right now and it taste great!

	This was my first 'nice' knife when I was taken in by the Santoku craze, and it was certainly a decent choice.  The knife is sharp out of the box, reasonably well balanced, and has pretty good fit/finish.  For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless/skinless chicken, etc., that are largely prepared, this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work.  The real drawback is the length.  When you live in the South, you see vidalia onions that are 7"" in diameter.  This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies.  And don't even think about getting it near hard melons or bone-in meats.  Since I got this knife, I've expanded my collection quite a bit, even adding some real Japanese steel.  But this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip, where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife can't get me to relinquish the big blade.  For most cooks, who need a real omni-tasker knife, I would look for a 9-10"" chef's knife rather than this.

542,"	Very pretty roasting pan  and  impressive gift
	If you have a good cook (or chef) in the family, this makes a very impressive gift.  It's a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking.

My only criticism of it is the lack of a non-stick interior.  You either will want to line the pan with foil before cooking anything that will generate a mess or where juices might burn, or you'll have to let it soak with a dryer sheet for a while afterwards.  The stainless doesn't retain messes so much as it just takes a bit of effort to get it completely clean.  But it's worth the effort - the pan cooks evenly, the rack is very sturdy.

Worth the money.

Watch out for the handles when they're hot - they don't fold down and it's easy to burn the underside of your arm or hands on them when you're moving it around while hot.

	I love my Donvier! I got it as a gift a number of years ago and won't let it out of my kitchen. Just last night, I made an impromtu batch of ice cream for a guest, using some over-ripe strawberries in the refrigerator. But once we got started we also added a banana and some pecans, first blended in the blender. The end result was scrumptuous.

Ice Cream making can be SOOOO easy with this little gadget. My grandchildren love for me to get it out. What a tasty treat! Who doesn't love home-made ice cream, especially when you can see it being made, or better still, help make it.

Keep the inner core in your freezer and the lightweight plastic outer container in a bottom cabinet. No mess, no fuss, no problem.

If you like ice cream and want a simple way of making it, this Donvier is the answer. Buy one. No, buy two and give one away. If I had not gotten mine as a gift, I might never have known the pleasure.

555,"	Easy and Cool In The Kitchen
	We had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50, when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single-cup brewer. I confess - I coveted this new machine in a big way. So when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new B70 last week on our front stoop, it was very much like Christmas for me. My wife just smiled, and the kids gave out a sincere, ""Whoa, that's cool!"" at our new kitchen friend.

Everything that we liked about the B50 is there for the B70 - with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel. The coffee just tastes good, first and foremost. I've tasted cups from other single-serve brewers, and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop-the-cup coffee. From my first experience with the Keurig machines, however, I was amazed how good the brew tasted. The home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot, or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine's brew basket got finicky. The additional My K-cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans, too - so as a coffee snob, I'm hooked.

The Platinum B70 adds selection for cup size - right now, I think our best default size is 9.25oz, filling out most travel mugs and our normal in-house mugs well without getting watery on the k-cups we've tried so far. And it has a larger reservoir for water, meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink. All of these things would be enough, right?

But wow, it is just so cool looking. The blue LED lights that make the water glow on the left, and the blue LCD screen on the right that shows the clock, menu, cup selection, and the chrome fixtures - even the spring-loaded holder in the front top of the brewer - all of that combines to make it more than just a good coffee, taking us into the realm of a really cool experience. The kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen, seeing Daddy's glowing blue coffee brewer, just wanting to marvel in its glow.... okay, that's a little too melodramatic, but only slightly.

If you like coffee and spend more than $10 per day, or throw away more than a third of a pot of coffee each morning, or if you enjoy coffee but avoid making it at night because for just one cup that whole pot will go to waste - I think you owe it to yourself to try this brewer out. Not just in the store, but blue and glowing in your own kitchen. Trust me - ""Merry Christmas"" is a great feeling

614,"	Surprisingly good kitchen shears
	I used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself, so I have tried many cutlery products from many different brands. In 2003, I bought these Calphalon Contemporary shears since I did not own a pair of shears. Before I purchased these, I tried a pair of Henckels Twinshear kitchen shears, and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as I would have liked. I was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in China rather than in Germany or Japan, even though newer brands such as Calphalon and Furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in China. After over a year of using these, I am quite impressed with them. The handles are very comfortable, and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned Henckels shears. Most impressively, the blades show very little wear, despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often. Also, the handles on these are far better compared to those on the Calphalon Traditional and Stainless shears. In conclusion, I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top-quality, reasonably priced set of kitchen shears

	The scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the ""Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale"" but it's a different model. The one I received uses the CR-2430 lithium battery, not four AAs as advertised. Also, the product manual is different. The actual manual's title is ""67000 - 67007 g/oz,"" not ""8122/8123 g/oz."" On the bottom of the scale, there is a number similar to Soehnle's product numbers, 812215. But I could not find such a product anywhere.

Fortunately, the maximum weight capacity of this scale is 5000g as advertised. It's actually about 5280g. The unit of measure is in 1g or 0.05oz increments. Weighing items with this scale is very easy. The LCD screen has large 0.5"" numbers. It has a 2-minute auto shut-off switch, and a supposedly low-battery indication.

Overall, this is a very good scale and I recommend it if you're willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while

636,"	my favorite mug
	I have four of these mugs.

Pros:
- Keeps coffee hot for a very long time when sealed.
- Doesn't leak.
- Durable.
- Carabiner makes it easy to clip onto backpack.

Cons:
- A little inconvenient to clean.
- Nissan unresponsive about replacement parts.

Tips:
Make sure the lid is screwed down snugly, but not too tightly. You want to form a complete seal to prevent leaks and retain heat, but the seal gets tighter as the contents cool and shrink.

Don't fill past the raised metal fill-line on the inside of the mug. If you overfill the mug, some liquid will be pushed up into the threads when you screw the lid down, and you won't notice until you tip the mug. (It's easier to see the line if you fill it beneath an overhead light.) If you think your mug leaks, you've probably overfilled it.

If you fill it just right, you don't even have to stir your coffee. Just add your sugar, cream, ketchup, or whatever you put in there, seal the lid, and shake the mug to mix it. (I've never been able to do this with any other mug).

When you wash the mug, remember to remove and wash the silicone rubber o-ring. The lid is hollow and can be pried apart with a spoon for cleaning if some liquid seeps inside.

If you wash the mug in the dishwasher (Nissan recommends against this), remove the plastic base before (or after) washing to remove the water that collects in there.

If you lose the gasket (or cut it on a knife in the dishwasher like I did), I've found these to be suitable inexpensive replacements after a lot of hunting around: 228 Silicone Rubber O-Ring 70A Durometer, Burnt Orange, 2-1/4"" ID x 2-1/2"" OD x 1/8"" W, by Small Parts Inc

	Until I purchased this meat grinder, I was grinding with a manual one.  It was a chore to set up and clean up.  The Pro MG-800 Professional Meat Grinder made the grinding easy.  It does not have to be clamped on the table.  Ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath.  Easy clean up, fast speed, three blades interchangeable for the grinding.  I am totally happy with the product I purchased.  Also, on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing.   The advantage of having a grinder is I can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat

646,"	A Bar Favourite!
	Tired of those metal cocktail shakers where the top refuses to open when you go to clean it?  The vacuum that occurs with the metal variety has happened to us on every model we've tried.  The Boston Cocktail Shaker does not have this problem.  We had no difficulty whatsoever with a tight seal on the first try and have had no leakage problems.  The only drawback (very minor) is that the measurement lines do not go all the way to the bottom of the glass.  So if you're measuring out small quantities of liquor, you still need to use a jigger.  Other than that, it is very easy to use and clean.  Top rating for this bar helper

	My dad originally bought one of these woks from lodge and we use it for everything. We can brown all sorts of meats for varying dishes. For Stir-frying it is incredible, nothing sticks to it and we don't have to  worry about even cooking. I have recently purchased one for myself and I  couldn't be happier with it. At less than 50 is is a great bargain. Another  great use for it is deep frying. It is a tad heavy so do not try to pick it  up and serve because it will very easily slip from your hands.

If you happen to forget to pack your skillet when you go camping, turn over the lid and put it back on the dutch oven. Voila! Instant skillet-type cooking surface!   Additionally, this smaller dutch oven stacks well with the 12-inch version, so you can cook more than one course at a time!

Having used a variety of dutch ovens in my life, I can tell you for sure, Lodge dutch ovens are the best. They are durable and well-crafted. If you have ever had the experience of cooking with a dutch oven that was not a Lodge, you will know what I mean. 

You should look for a dutch oven that has a lip on the lid for keeping coals on, and sturdy legs, to keep from crushing the coals. Lodge dutch ovens have these features, and are made of quality cast iron. Lodge also has many accessories for cooking, such as lid lifters and lid rests, inserts for muffins, etc.

Lodge also has many accessories for cooking, such as lifts and lid leftovers, inserts for muffins, etc. Dutch stoves are a great gift for the motorhome in your life. Highly recommended"
681,"	A review NOT from a seller
	The other review is so obviously someone from SENTRY that I thought I'd add my two cents. My house hasn't burned down so I don't know if this works, but I've read other articles that say it does. It is heavy (since the foam contains water to evaporate and dissipate heat in a fire), and there is no rubber grips on the bottom, so it can slide around a lot. It's a lot cheaper and more convient than renting a safety deposit box.

682,"	Good value fire protection
	Sentry Insulated Chest

Every household should have some method of protecting things like birth certificates, deeds, wills, stocks, bonds, and other valuables.

Pros:

  - Inexpensive box helps keeps your valuables ""safe"" from fire, kids, and nosey adults.
  - Attractive; has nice handle; no sharp edges.
  - Excellent value for the money.

Cons:

  - Flat key model (SEN1100) has a rather cheap-looking lock mechanism.
  - It weighs nearly 20 pounds, but that's because the walls are 1"" thick and fire-resistant material isn't light.

Go to sentrysafe dot com to view all the Sentry offerings.  

My advice is to buy the Sentry model 2100 rather than this model (SEN1100).  The 2100 has a better (tubular key) lock, but only costs a few dollars more.  (Staples dot com sells the 2100.)  Sentry rates these boxes as follows:

1100 - UL classified - 30 minute fire protection
2100 - ETL verified for 30 minute fire protection of CDs and DVDs up to 1550 degrees F

No small fire-box is particularly theft resistant.  Even if bolted down, a lid could be forced opened with tools.  In addition, although the 2100's fire rating is higher than the 1100, many non-portable safes offer better fire ratings.  They are also larger and far more expensive.  For better protection, you'd need to spend more money, but a Sentry chest is much better than doing nothing.

I use mine to store DVD backups of computer files.  The Sentry chest is kept inside a large, fire-resistant safe.  Hopefully, this double protection will do the job if there is ever a fire.  DVD and other computer media will be destroyed at much lower temperatures than paper.

698,"	Don't put it in the freezer and the blade assembly won't break
	Enough said.

DON'T PUT A FROZEN JAR ON THE BASE AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO REPLACE THE BLADE ASSEMBLY.  I am sure the owners manual says that someplace.

My Kitchen Aid became unusable because replacement blades were not available 16 months after I purchased it.  Aren't you glad you could purchase the replacement part?

My story:  My son put his leftover smoothie into the freezer, jar and all.  The next day when he took the jar out of the freezer and put it on the Kitchen Aid blender, the motor broke the blade assembly.  The motor base was still good and I liked the blender.  Kitchen Aid changed their model and didn't make replacement parts.  I think it is unreasonable for a manufacturer to not have replacement parts available after just 16 months.  (...)!

I can't say enough good things about the quality and ease of use of my Cuisinart blender.  The jar's shape helps the food move and mix better than a round jar.  The jar's size is larger than any I have found.  I pour from the corner of the jar if the mix is too thick to pour from the spout (which I concede is a little wide).  The weight keeps the blender in place.  The shipping weight is around 15 LBS is that too heavy?  Maybe you should skip the smoothies and switch to a muscle building drink.  Most every quality blender has weight to it.  The plastic units are light and considered disposable.  Keep buying those $30 disposable blenders if you want, however I'll keep my Cuisinart!

The three year warranty and Cuisinart's backing keep us, the consumer, in parts when we do something stupid (like putting the frozen smoothie mix on the blender and breaking the blade assembly).  (...) replacement blade assembly is cheaper than being FORCED to purchase a new blender (Kitchen Aid).

Buy the Cuisinart a great value for a quality product.

716,"	Very Nicely-Built Aebleskiver Pan
	I've been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no-name cast iron pan that I bought in Solvang ten years ago.  It is very well broken in with a smooth non-stick patina in all seven indents.  I want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon, and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies!  

Therefore, I have been looking to buy some additional aebleskiver pans and I was excited to see this new pan from Lodge, so I ordered one to give it a try.  I like the design a lot and am impressed with how it heats up quickly and holds it's temperature nicely.  The first batch of aebleskivers had some sticking, but I expected that.  I will need to use it a lot more before it has the same non-stick surfaces as my old pan (no, it's not for sale!), but I can tell that this pan will get there with use.

By the way, I've found that there are many recipes for aebleskivers and several different techniques for cooking them.  I'm sure that they all will work well with some practice, but I'll describe the one that I've settled on, because it is so easy:

Heat the pan at a medium-low setting.  Take about two cups of prepared pancake mix (I use Krusteaz Buttermilk) and add a couple of teaspoons of sugar.  Mix it in and stir in enough cold water to make the consistency about the same as you would for drop bisquits.  Don't overmix it and let it sit for awhile to rise a bit before you cook it.  Put a little butter or margerine in each indent and add about a teaspoonful of batter to each indent (If you're new to aebleskivers, I recommend trying only three at once.)  I then drizzle a little butter on the edges of each indent.  After about a minute, I use a knitting needle (or chopstick) to turn each aebleskiver one quarter turn.  I add a little more butter and then turn them so the round side is up.  I keep turning them with a spoon until they're done.  (You'll just have to break one of them open to check, because it's dependent on your batter and temperature.)

Once you get it down (usually after a few rejects), serve them in threes on a small plate with thinned out raspberry jam and powdered sugar.  Once you eat them, you'll understand why people go through all this just to make a pancake that looks like a racquetball!
",1,"Very nice built Aebleskiver pan I have been cooking Aebleskiver for a few years now in an excellent cast iron no-name pan that I bought ten years ago in Solvang. It is very well broken with a smooth non-stick patina in all seven indents. I want to teach my sons how to cook apples themselves, because they will soon be travelling alone, and it never hurts to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies! So I looked for additional Aebleskiver pans and was thrilled to see this new pan from Lodge, so I ordered one to try it out. I like the design very much and am impressed by how quickly it heats up and keeps its temperature good. The first game of the Aebleskis had something crunchy, but I expected it. I have to use it much more before it has the same non-stick surface as my old pan (no, it's not for sale! ), but I can say that this pan will get there with effort. By the way, I found out that there are many recipes for Aebleskis and different cooking techniques. I am sure that with a little practice they will all work well, but I will describe the ones I have been involved in because it is so simple: heat the pan at medium to low temperature. Take about two cups of prepared pancake mixture (I use crustacean buttermilk) and add a few teaspoons of sugar. Mix in enough cold water to maintain the consistency of the drip cookies. Do not overmix it and let it rest for a while to allow it to rise a little before cooking. Add a little butter or daisies to each mirror stroke and add about a teaspoon of batter to each mirror stroke (If you are a newcomer to aesthetics, I recommend trying only three at a time.) Then I drizzle some butter on the edges of each indentation. After about a minute I turn each abre flip by a quarter turn with a knitting needle (or chopsticks)."

718,"	The secret to success!!!
	This is a wonderful can opener!!! I wouldn't have any other. The trick to having perfectly cut edges is to let the can spin around twice. I hold onto the can so that when it starts making its second round, I tighten my grip a little and the moment the lid comes lose it starts spinning. I have noticed that if I buy the dirt cheap, no name vegetables at the dollar store, the opener has difficulty. I guess one should blame the can and not the opener. It is a small price to pay for having such a safe appliance around. But then my opener is a couple years old so maybe my blade is just wearing out... If there is no replacement blade, you can bet I will buy another can opener just like this, and if I have to, on Ebay! 
I am sure this new technology has saved more than one lost or stray animal digging at the landfill or in the alley for a morsel of food. I just couldn't bear the thought of someone's lost puppy or an abandoned cat getting his tongue cut. Those old can openers are just plain dangerous. Call me a bleeding heart but it matters. It's not like my own pet couldn't knock the trash over when I'm gone and end up cutting themselves on one of those old fashioned, razor sharp lids. There are both elderly and child relatives in my house all the time and I just don't feel safe with those old tin cutters around. 
All it takes is a little patience with new technology and using this can opener on more than just a couple cans to get the hang of it. There is no need to slam this appliance on the counter or floor. That's rediculous. As far as oversized cans, that's not what this was made for.

	I have to admit that I was surprised when the rolling pin arrived. I'm used to OXO quality, but this is over the top. It is a big rolling pin, with an ideal diameter. It is also heavy. It's heft helps keep it where it belongs, instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder. It has a strong axle, which glides remarkably smoothly, even when the pressure is on. The hard non stick surface works very well, and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings. The handles are simply the best I have have encountered.

720,"	best lunch box ever - hot food stays hot for hours !!!
	I had seen my Japanese coworkers carry this thing to work.  It's a great lunch bag! Beats brown bagging, because hot foods stay hot, and cold foods stay cold.  I finally bought one because of the ease of use, didn't want to keep paying $$$ for hot lunches, and I can always bring my favorite foods.  The bottom container is the only leakproof container. (That is my only gripe.) I usually put soup in here.  The other containers will hold things without sauces very well.  It's great because it allows for a large variety of foods (better nutrition).  I have used bento lunch boxes since I was kid, and this is the best for adults. I like asian food, and this type of lunch box accomodates the best. 

If you want to fill hot food, then pour in hot water in the containers for 10 minutes, let it get warm.  Pour out the water, dry.  Then fill.  If you want ice cold food, put in freezer for 10 minutes, then put food in.   

They also make bigger versions for larger appetites and another smaller one for small appetites.  They really do stay hot. Once I had to take a very late lunch, I packed it at 7am, and at 2:30pm the food was still hot. No more waiting in line to microwave your lunch !!!

	When I decided to buy this oven, I was not even looking to buy a convection toaster oven.  I stumbled across this item looking for cookware.  I read all the reviews, thought about it a few days and then decided to just buy it.  Boy, am I glad that I did!!!  And so is my family.  The day we received it, I cooked muffins for my daughter and her friend for a snack.  Extremely easy.  All I needed was six muffins and the oven did just that for me.  Since then, we have cooked more muffins, a meatloaf, bacon, toast, english muffins, chicken strips, waffles and bratwurst.  My kitchen doesn't heat up like when I use my regular oven and the food has turned out better than when cooked in the regular oven.  It was so easy for my husband to use this also while I was shopping and I just gave him a 15 second class before I left.  I didn't notice any smoking when cooking meat or any of the other foods.  This is my first Convection Toaster oven, which has replaced the microwave and toaster, and I can assure you we expect to use this oven alot.  I love the design, the warming tray does just that, even when you have something else cooking you can throw buns or anything else up top to keep warm.  It's great!

724,"	1/2 Toaster, 1/2 Oven
	Very good buy for $85 +free ship. Bought this one to replace a smaller Black  and  Decker toaster oven that served us very well over 5-6 years until controls gave out (the B and D still works, just have to keep the button pressed in).  

I looked at reviews of several toaster ovens before purchasing the T-Fal.  The less expensive ones ($25-$40) were getting dinged because of occasional mentions of overheating or fire risk.  Not worth the chance.  I also wanted something as small as possible because we have little counter space in our 10' x 10' kitchen, so a more expensive one was not an option.  

The T-fal gave dimensions on Amazon  and  it was 3 inch wider, deeper, taller than our B and D.  No big deal - wrong.  It was bigger than I thought when I put it on the counter, looked like a monster compared to the B and D.  Also, I could not open the top warmer lid to the point it stays open.  This because of height restrictions -- bottom of my kitchen cabinet is at about 54 - 60 inches.  I can open the top, but I need to hold it open.  My fault, not the product or mfr.  But be aware that size matters in a small kitchen.

The function buttons are very simple, nothing complicated - one button for toast, one for bake, another for broil.  You can set how long it stays on, and it beeps (electronically) three times when it shuts off.  There is a clock, but it could be easier to set.  

I mainly use it to toast bread, bagels, sandwiches and to bake small pizzas (sauce with cheese on a pita - easy).  The toast function takes longer than the old B and D (about 4.5 vs 2 minutes), but thats OK by me.  The bake function works very well, I prefer it muchly over starting the oven to bake something small.

Clean-up is a snap with a removeable crumb tray, glass doors and non-stick surfaces.

Negatives: you can pull the rack out about 30-40 percent before it tips forward and burns you.  It's controllable, not a big deal, unless you don't know about it.  I did know thanks to previous reviews and I was prepared for it.  
The fan was louder than I expected (I expected no noise since the B and D has no fan).  But it is a soft sound, lower than my computer fan and only on during cooking.

Overall, it's a well built, well-designed machine.

725,"	A little too helpful. . .
	Overall this is a fine scale.  One ""convenient"" feature is an auto zero function.  If the scale has been tared and the tare weight removed, rather than displaying a negative weight, the scale automatically re-zeros.  This may be handy most of the time, but sometimes it's a pain.  With my old scale, I could tare a partially filled bowl, remove the bowl from the scale, add more goodies, and place it back on the scale to determine the weight of the additional material.  That doesn't work with this scale--it rezeros when a tared weight is removed

The medium ones and the large ones are for leftovers, soup fixings, freezer meals, steaming chicken, fruit salad et al. 

I'm ten percent tempted to try out the rectangular ones because some foods I don't want to freeze in a stack but I don't think I would get as much use out of them as I do these round ones.  I really would like to buy a fifth set but I won't. I rarely have more than one or two empty ones to spare. These get used all the time.

	I do a lot of stir frying, using one pan to do many dishes.  As a result I needed a pan that had non-stick quality for quick and easy cleaning and one that could take high heat from my professional stovetop.  When pan and oil are heated to the right temperature the interior 18/10 stainless steel surface behaved as if it were nonstick.  The heat was evenly conducted bottom through the sides, this due to the aluminium core sandwich being continuous from the bottom up the sides.  The sides are high enough to not have food spill out in the process of vigourous stir frying. The height is also good for small item deep frying.  The steep sloping of the sides enabled food to rotate well, falling back easily into the pan.  Quality pans tend to be heavy,  All Clad without exception but this size is perfectly manageable for tossing ingredients if need to.  It also cooks a generous portion for one to two persons.  All types(including metal) of utensils can be used with it.  This is a solid, handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and use.

Quality pans are usually heavy, all without exception, but this size is perfectly manageable to throw ingredients when it needs to be. She also cooks a generous portion for one or two people. All kinds of utensils (including metal) can be used with it. This is a solid, handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and application. It is a pleasure to cook with her and one that gives you the confidence that it will last long, long."
745,"	Like having a coffe shop in your kitchen
	I first would like to say that if you are the occasional esspresso drinker, then this machine is to costly to use every once in a while go with a cheaper brand.  Now for the rest of you that are die hard esspresso drinkers this is the machine for you.

I moved from AK to NY a few months ago, while I lived in AK (ALASKA) there were coffe shops on every corner, to say the least I was addicted to mochas, and moving to NY they are few and far between.  I was going into withdrawl.  After doing some research I found this great machine.  I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review about it.  I love this machine.  This machine is fast and the esspresso is great.  I am a fan of regular esspresso as well and it comes out at a consistanly high quality,  the Crema is perfect, however I found if you are using the single shot it doesn't come out that great so always use the double shot.  The machine heats up quickly and everything is provided for you, two cups, two saucers, a pitcher and a frothing attachment.  I can see that this machine will pay for itself withing no time.  I have owned cheaper models in the past and you can really tell the difference in the quality of the esspresso.  I have not used the pod attachment so I can't comment on that.  If you buy the machine in my opinion you wont be disappointed

  Some of the heat from the water is lost from the initial contact with the carafe, so the liquid you store will always be a little cooler than its intial temperature.

759,"	We made not only the right choice but the Best Choice!
	For years we have used the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea makers and have purchased two of them.  This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker.  Even though I/we haven't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee.  First of all the taste (using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers.   Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket, for the bags, sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir, where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher.  Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker.  Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it.  This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought, before my purchase, that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better.  On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket (mild, medium, strong), we usually use Medium.  

We enjoy ""Sweet-Tea"" being from the South and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it's hot at the time of brewing.  Our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed.  Once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea every-time.  If you enjoy tea, even if you never considered an electric tea maker, the Hamilton Beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret.  Having two Mr. Coffee makers before this Hamilton Beach I don't see myself ever purchasing another Mr. Coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker.  I HIGHLY recommend the Hamilton Beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the Mr. Coffee, it's totally worth it

Also due to the combs in the bottom of the coffee maker, it is usually almost impossible to clean the pot completely and bring it back to its clean state when you first used it.

The handles and the nonstick surface have had no problems at 450 degrees. Other brands that I have used deteriorate rapidly at 400 degrees or above. Keep in mind I am not a cook and by my very method of cooking (set oven to high and wait til you smell something burning) I am very hard on pans of any kind. A very high quality product that I would have gladly paid 50 bucks for. By the way, the cooling rack is nonstick as well.

771,"	Fantastic idea, beautifully simple
	This is a fantastic idea for teaballs. Sleek and stylish, this set is also practical.

The two teaballs are spring-loaded, and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea. Simply press the plunger, then stir the ball around in your loose tea container. Lift it out of the tea and shake the excess out to level the tea. Let go of the plunger, and the teaball closes securely. The long stem on the balls allow you to take the ball out of your cup (or stir the tea as it's brewing, if that's your preference) without having to lift a hot chain off of the side of your cup of hot water.

Prior to this purchase, we used a tea 'spoon', which also spring-loaded shut. The problem with the spoon is that to fill it with tea, you have to hold it vertically in the container, which means you have few options - either close the spoon while the tea is still sticking out the sides, and fill your cup with loose tea, or try to shake the extra tea out after you pull the spoon of the container, and get tea all over your counter. Because of these teaballs' design, they don't share that problem.

The tower has one interesting feature, but some shortcomings. The good design is that below where each teaball hangs, there is a significant 'bowl' to catch any tea that might still be dripping. This has proven to be a very handy feature. The tower itself isn't very mobile, however. Due to how the hooks hold the teaball stems, it is seemingly impossible to move without one of the balls falling out. Also, when I got mine, the tower was visibly crooked, and I had to bend it back straight. That worked for me, but was quite hard, and I was worried I'd break it.

Oh, cleanup - cleanup is much easier than with the aforementioned spoon. The spoon hinges so that there is little clearance at the back of the utensil for washing out. These balls don't share that problem at all. The plunger gives more than adequate clearance to simply turn the ball sideways and wash it out in the sink (just make sure your sink's filter is in!)

All in all, I'm pleased with the purchase. It's such a fantastic idea that a few shortcomings don't significantly mar how well the product works

775,"	Best of the Small Digital Thermometers
	In my opinion:

Well, I ordered two of these, one for my Daughter. Since I had two, guess what I did? You're right - I tested both on the same hot and cold materials to see how close they read. Well, they were within 1/2 degree F. of each other, which in a laboratory is sloppy, but for cooking food, it's darn accurate. 

I have several oven thermometers, you know, the mechanical ones, and I use this unit to see how accurate they are. 
Also, I wanted a thermometer to be able to check the temperature of thinner foods, such as a hamburger, chicken patty, chicken breasts. Now, as you know, when you check the temperature of these items, you want a really quick reading, because your hand is close to the heat. Well, it's not as quick as advertised. It will take about 8 to 10 seconds to get a good reading, but that's not terribly long. Make sure you slide the temp probe through the handle so that your hand can be even further away from the fire.

Next, it can be calibrated, so I put it up against a $400 Fluke meter, and it came within .8 degrees F, so I would consider it within specs. For food preparation, the difference would have no meaning. 

Finally, it seems to be holding up well against accidental drops and getting slightly wet. I've bought others, including those ridiculous forks with the built-in thermometers, but this unit is the best

Their customer service was outstanding, and I feel they build a quality product. I also purchased the rectangular version of La Cloche, and I have not had an issue.

792,"	I'm The Baker
	I love to bake.  I really love to bake bread.  My specialty is sourdough.  So now I have 3 strikes against me, that is, until I found La Cloche.  

Although it can be used to cook meats, I personally only use it for bread.  La Cloche turns your regular oven into a brick oven, and the quality of your bread will amaze you.  It browns beautifully, has a crispy, chewy crust that seems to carmelize the sugars in the crust differently.  There is no need to spray water or create steam in the oven, because the steam is created inside La Cloche by the bread itself.  So actually bread making is more simple and safe because you are not spraying water into a 500 degree oven. 

There are 2 shapes, a french bread style and round oven hearth style.  I have both and pop them into the oven at the same time, so I am baking 2 loaves of bread at once, which is a little more economical.   

Truly, I wish I had this from the beginning of my baking attempts.  If you are a baker or love one, go ahead and spring for it.  You will never regret this kitchen tool.   All my other bread pans are now unused

793,"	Not that bad..
	First of all, they aren't really intended for the novice user, but they are perfect for the long run. The wooden ones WILL rot before you ever get skilled with them, but these stainless steel ones will take a licking and keep on picking.

One thing the description doesn't say, is that they ARE made to be used as chopsticks and they can really function like them. 

Maybe on the descriptions from before they said they are slippery and they don't have any grip. I never had any problem with that depending on what I tried to grab. I was able to grab chopped steaks and even some vegetables with these utensils, though I haven't tried noodles yet.

Another thing I need to point out that the description doesn't. These utensils aren't round. The handles are square, as the points are rounded. The tips are blunted so grabbing things becomes awkward until you learn to get ""around"" the item you want to pick up. If you know how to use chopsticks and pick up things with them, you'll only have a very slight adjustment to make with these.

All in all, for their originality and how they are made, I give them a four and a half out of five.

If you wanted chopsticks to replace fickle and often unwashable wooden ones, these are the kind you want to get, definately

794,"	Feels like home
	My mother is Korean and so I grew up using stainless steel chopsticks.  Apparently they're quite popular in Korean households...as well as stainless steel rice bowls.  You might have seen them, the ones with the stainless lids?

Anyway.  These are just like the ones I grew up using.  There are some drawbacks (like the noodle comment made earlier) but it's not a product flaw.  Yes, wooden chopsticks are going to grip better, but they also tend to mildew if used repeatedly and have to be restocked.  Lacquer coated wooden chopsticks tend to flake after a while.  And besides, when eating asian food you don't really pick up individual noodles (which would have you slipping and sliding).  You sorta grab a large portion and bring your face close to the bowl and slurp them down.  I think the Japanese actually bring the bowl to their face instead.  Trust me...it all goes where it needs to.  

The main thing is getting use to their diameter.  These are much more slender than the wooden chopsticks you see in restaurants.  Not for the novice chopsticker

	I don't know how anyone could think that the outlast material isn't working.  (..of course it has been significantly tested and proven that it works.)  At first its cool.  After about 5 minutes (depending on the person) outlast starts keeping an even temp.. 
 
Now that even temp. may not be as cool as you want - but it never gets much warmer than you are UNLIKE most every other pillow (..even buckwheat pillows which become hotter because of the fabric encasing the buckwheat).

The negatives are however:

1. The outlast material needs to be pretty close to your body to work - and it DOES have a distinctive texture that is a broad weave box pattern and is ""stiff"" (..though after a few washings it becomes considerably softer).  You might not like this textural feeling.

2. Other than the outlast, the pillow is nothing special.  The support is poor like most pillows, the interesting thing here though is that you can remove the stuffing - and fill it with a material you find acceptable (..if you don't like the standard poly fill), but you will need to do some minor sewing on the seam you opened to remove and replace the filling

	I got this rice cooker about 8 months ago, and I have probably used it once a week since then. It most certainly makes better rice than I could before (cooking in a pot on the stove), but the results are often inconsistent. 

Sometimes the rice seems to get dried out and burns at the bottom. I think I need to up the liquid to rice ratio.

My first waffle came out beautifully and you-know-who ate it with great satisfaction and requested another.  Then I screwed up.  You see, if you don't follow directions and forget to rotate the waffle maker your waffle splits in half and can't be put back together again!  Third time I did it right.

Waffle grids slide out easily for cleaning in the dishwasher.  Outside of stainless steel appliance my be cleaned with soap and water or glass cleaner if you prefer.  Handle folds down and therefore the appliance stores easily.

I was too busy to follow the gram instructions in the recipe booklet accompanying the waffle maker and too busy to beat egg whites separately.  So I used my tried and true pancake recipe which turned out great.  In the future I'll be more creative!

My wife, a native of southwestern China, joined me in the USA this year.  She thoroughly approved of my choice.  And, boy, does she make the best stir fried vegetables in the world.

True, it is heavy, but that is good news because now we have an electric stove and the thick steel helps distribute the heat well. (In China we had a gas stove with a huge flame.)

I still don't understand all the rituals involved with ""seasoning.""  In China I was taught to scrub it hard after cooking with a stainless steel or brass scrubber in hot soapy water, then dry it very well before heating it just a little and rubbing it down with oil (we use a paper towel) on the inner surface.  Store it oiled!  Rarely have we had any sticking problems.

A little scrubbing gets the rust right off if you forget to dry and oil, so don't panic!

847,"	Great design, great function
	I was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable. I thought a french press would be a great idea, but all of them seemed to be made of glass and I didn't want to leave my press laying around where I work (we share space with other companies so people come and go). With this mug all I have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea (and maybe some sugar). Wait a bit, push down the press and drink. The whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber. The bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh. 

I read another review of the mug somewhere and they complained about getting coffee grinds coming through. Well let me say this mug has a double filter, one on the plunger part of the press and one on the lid where you drink or pour from. Coffee used for french press preperation is supposed to be a coarse grind. I think that person tried using store bought ground coffee or just didn't know any better and put finely ground coffee in. The mug will do a pretty good job even with coffee like that, but some is bound to get through that way and you get a muddy cup besides the point so use coffee made for french press brewing not finely ground coffee and you will love this mug

	I have bought this timer numerous times, and, after a few years, after it falls into a pot of soup or something, I go buy another. Reasons: a) the programmable timer which allows you to time several dishes simultaneously. b) Sturdiness. Its magnet does not stay glued to the back forever, but otherwise it's durable for an everyday electronic gadget - you should get several years of use out of it. c) It's one of the only timers I can find - and I look at big box stores, major discount stores, the supermarket, etc. - that allow you to time dishes longer than an hour or 99 minutes. This is important for pot roast, big chickens, turkeys, unusual dishes that simmer overnight, and so on. 

I recently bought it at Amazon because the big box store where I used to get it, now only carries from Pyrex a much more complex version which you don't need for everyday cooking.

	In my opinion this is the best kitchen timer out there!  

It has FOUR separate programmable digital timers that can count up and/or down - each with their own alarm sound.  It also has a regular clock setting.  Plus, you can either plop it on the fume hood using the magnet on the back of it, clip it to your apron using the clip or set it on the counter using it's support stand.  Oh, and did I mention how small it is?...just another nice feature! 

So yeah, no more having to set the oven timer, the microwave timer and my watch timer in order to keep track of all the various foods cooking at the same time.

Not only do I use this timer in the kitchen constantly I also use it for numerous other things too.  It's the ""Time Out"" timer for the kids, a ten-minute reminder when I need to get us all out of the house...you name it!

My Mother owns this same timer and is the one that originally introduced me to it, thank heavens!  I can't imagine running a kitchen without this hard to find item.  If you check out Bed, Bath  and  Beyond you'll see they don't have anything with FOUR programmable timers.

Long story short...if you purchase this timer I promise you will NOT be disappointed.

858,"	A great starter piece or addition to your Le Creuset collection
	Le Creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products. Le Creuset casts these cooking vessels from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once. For this reason, one pot may look like another, but each is unique in its own way. 

Cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently. It is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat. However, there are exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay. Remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly. This heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving. Beware; iron tends to be heavy so are these cooking vessels. 

Cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel? Iron tends to rust; iron oxide (rust) doesn't add any complimentary flavors to your food. If your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled, you would have to season and maintain your cooking vessel. Adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good, but has multiple benefits. The enamel, being a solid coating, is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on, does not stain, absorb odors, retain flavors, and is easy to clean. The enamel can be damaged, so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood. 

The benefits of cooking with Le Creuset cast iron are many, but lets get down to the buffet casserole specifically. The buffet casseroles are one of the most versatile pieces in the Le Creuset lineup.  Use this pan as a saut� pan, a roasting pan, for poaching, or as a shallow braiser.  The 3.5 quart capacity can is plenty of space when it comes to casseroles, so consider your recipes when determining the size you need. The buffet casserole tends to do best if at least three quarters full. Any less and you may overwhelm your food with the evenly dispersed heat in the pot. 

With a large flat bottom that curves up this pan resembles a curved sided saute pan the only thing missing would be a long handle. The tight fitting lid is mostly flat with curved sides. This lid seals in heat, moisture, and flavors and can be used to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings. Its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan. 

I tend to use this pot for basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else. But once you get past the basic functionality that lends itself to recipes such as paella, frittatas, deep dish pizza, and casseroles, you can really open up the possibilities.  Keep in mind this is a 3.5 quart pan, feeding two out if it is ridiculous unless you want leftovers. It is probably the perfect size for a family of four in most cases.  Try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding for when you need to please many guests, poaching fish, or Mac and Cheese. The possibilities almost seem endless. 

One feature that people tend to complain about is the cost. The cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials. Heck, cast iron doesn't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping. However the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced. They then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans. If you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products, the cost tends to make sense. Then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of.
PROS: 
Extremely versatile 
Efficient absorption and distribution of heat 
Hygienic enamel cooking surface 
Does not stain, absorb odors, or retain flavors 
Easy to clean when not abused or misused 
Can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table 
Can easily last a lifetime 

CONS: 
Its heavy, as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 12.25 pounds

	I bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it's still working perfectly.  It's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days.  We no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine.  I've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can't live without it now.

Few things of note:

* Even with Vacu Vin, the wine will start to change flavor if kept over a week.

* You do need to pump a lot more than the instruction indicates.  Keep pumping until you feel a strong resistance.

* Vacu Vin cannot be used for wines with fizz (such as Vino Verde, Champagne, etc).  The reduced pressure will suck the gas out of the wine and make it flat very quickly.

* It's better to keep the bottle upright so there's no pressure on the rubber stopper (It does not need to stay moist like a cork).

Its purpose is to keep a leftover wine until you finish it, and it does that quite well

They are a bit messy to clean up, but its a fair trade off for the awesome coffee and the cost savings over the pods or actually going to starbucks. I would estimate I will get 50-60 cups out of a $6 store bought bag of coffee. Basically, one heaping teaspoon fills up the ecopad perfectly. Also I would estimate getting hundreds of uses out of each ecopad - they seem very durable. I am looking forward to trying different coffee's with these. Well worth the tiny investment
",1,"works fine After reading the reviews I decided to try them out, as I was not impressed by the cost or quality of the Senseo pods. After I had my three sets in the post, I went to my grocery store, bought all the beans from Starbucks, chopped them into Expresso regrind and went to try the eco-pads. I followed the instructions, put the eco-pad in the machine (perfect fit), pressed the 8oz button, and wa - la! I would urge anyone to recognise the difference between the stuff you pay $3.50 a cup for at Starbucks. I'm definitely addicted. I can't see how other reviewers had problems with them.

877,"	Great Sauce Pan
	I love to cook, and own several different brands of cookware, All Clad, Cuisinart, and Calaphone.  This sauce pan didn't disappoint me.  I love it!!  The pan has a wider bottom than most 2 or 2 1/2 quart pans.  This is great if you need to saute onions or peppers at the beginning of a sauce, or if you need a little extra room to stir something.  I am very, very happy with this

This is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the ""George Foreman"" grill was a bit faster, I was amazed I thought the Delonghi cooked pretty fast!!  Clean up was really easy and one MUST remember to preheat it.  I gather some have not.  And as to smoking I haven't had any but then I buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if I think the food will drip a lot of fat.  Fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke.  I've only used water once, with the hamburgers (no smoking).  This really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying (actual cooking space is 15""x11"").  Ease and comfort of use is amazing.  I highly recommend it!

	I purchased the Cuisinart grinder from Amazon based upon customer reviews just over two years ago after trying two cheaper $20-ish models picked up at local discount stores.  Motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order; the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2-3 months in a storage building. The motor on the Cuisinart is still going strong, but I had to trash it today.  I have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1-3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight,  but that's to be expected with a blade grinder.  The on/off button broke about 2 months ago; then, last week, the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite John Conti beans.  Others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models, but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee!  If I don't try a higher quality burr grinder, I may get another one of these!

Yes, they do rust, although I did not have this problem with my kit (I had it for about four months now) because I only wash them by hand and dry them immediately. A steak knife found its way into the dishwasher and came out with a small rust spot that could be easily removed with a little steel wool. You only have to weigh the advantages of all metal knives against the advantages of wood or plastic knives."
910,"	A good little fan.
	This little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt.
All in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you

	I have owned my fair share of indoor grills, from a Foreman grill to a really heavy grill pan which I ordered through Amazon. Not too long ago I recently acquired the Calphalon grill pan because my Foreman grill is too small if I want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time. Plus the black coating on my Foreman grill is wearing out. So I bought the Calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store. I haven't been able to get enough of it. It is so easy to clean even when I had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in Italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed, garlic, shallots, and extra virgin olive oil. The marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it wasn't non-stick. I also like using the Calphalon grill pan because I can cook both the meat and vegetable (say asparagus) at the same time. The results are fabulous. I get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste. Although it is a bit big for this apartment dweller, I still consider this grill pan the best of all the indoor grills I have owned. Well worth the money too

	I'm thoroughly impressed by this set of inexpensive skillets: each of the three are the right size for my use:  Small skillet for nice round pancakes, larger skillet for general stir-fry, the griddle for bacon, eggs and toasting bread (with more than enough real-estate to cook two of three at the same time - could have crammed in the bacon but that releases too much fat).  

The best part about this entire set is that it cleans up so well - i'm coming from some lousy Tefal (remember when they were actually a premium brand with good quality? those times have long gone) which stained really badly, not to mention the nonstick flaking off after a couple uses.

	I have used this griddle so much I have worn it out and am now going to buy another one.  I have great results making flour tortillas with it.  I always use the quaker flour torilla mix from wal-mart.

943,"	Very good, but expect some hiccups getting started
	We needed a small countertop dishwasher for our rec room, and after a few months of use, I can say this one is working out very well.

It shipped quickly, with no damage (the box was pretty tattered, but the packing material and the actual dishwasher were fine). It's large for a countertop device, certainly bigger than most microwaves. Be sure to measure your available space, especially clearance to any cabinets above your installation site.

I hit some minor bumps getting it installed. The dishwasher hose nozzle is supposed to connect to your kitchen faucet using a threaded  quick-connect coupler included in the box. The coupler is supposed to screw onto the end of the faucet, but the faucet on that sink was a removeable spray handle on a long hose. There's no way for the included adapter to hook up to this, so I wound up having to install a new faucet (this isn't as bad as it sounds, as we were planning to replace the old one anyway).

I brought the quick connect adapter to the hardware store with me to be sure it would fit the threads on the new faucet. Everything seemed okay in the store, but when I got home and installed the new faucet, I had some trouble. It turns out that the included adapter isn't particularly good quality, and didn't fit the faucet threads tightly enough to stay in place once the water pressure was actually turned on.

I blew the hose nozzle off the end of the new faucet a couple of times until I finally went back to the hardware store and picked up an off-the-shelf adapter. Fortunately, it looks like Danby is using all standard-sized parts, so I was able to replace the flaky adapter with a new one that works well for only a couple of dollars.

Once I had the thing up and running, it was easy to load and use. The basket is built to hold four full place settings, but I find that with some creative jiggering I can get it to take in any odd collection of dishes, mugs, baby cups, storage containers and what have you. The basket insert is removeable, converting it to an all-glasses tray, which we found useful for party cleanup.

The machine really heats the water, so dishes come out clean. Even sticky stuff like melted cheese usually cleans right up. I've never had to use the heat-boost ""sanitize"" setting.

It uses a very small amount of dishwasher soap and rinse fluid, and you want to be careful NOT to add too much. I made the mistake of overfilling the soap holder (spilled a little too much, figured it would just rinse out, oops) and wound up flooding my countertop in suds. This has only happened once and there was no damage. Call it a learning experience.

I saw in some of the other reviews that the timer knob occasionally won't advance when you start running the machine, and this did happen to me once as well after I'd had it for about two weeks. It hasn't recurred since then, either becuase I've been particularly careful to set the timer in the right start position, or the timer's ""wearing in.""

Been using it steadily several times a week for a few months now, and after the initial hiccups, it's been working fine. No complaints, and now I'm looking for a Danby under-counter mini-refigerator to replace one in the same rec room. I'd recommend this dishwasher, provided you don't mind a little effort getting it dialed in

950,"	Worthwhile Purchase
	Had to turn in the first unit I bought for a replacement because a small plastic piece on the filter basket door broke, rendering the door useless.  The replacement has worked fine, but I am very careful in swinging the door open.
Can't understand the nitpicking of other reviewers on the spillage when pouring from the carafe, and the forming of air bubbles in the water level tube.  Both problems are easily solved by pouring slowly enough.
As to the peeling of the coating on the heating plate, I haven't had that happen either in the original unit or the replacement.
I agree the instructions for setting the time on the clock and for the timer are a little complex - every time we have a power outage I have to refer to the manual to reset times.  However, the timer feature has worked without fail, unlike the Mr. Coffees I've had.
I need to add that the poor visibility of the display is annoying.  Unless I'm missing something, it's backlit only when the unit is on or you're resetting times.
Every coffeemaker has its pros and cons, for this one the pros far outweigh the cons. Overall, a fine machine which makes great coffee (hint: if you disagree with the great coffee try one of the Caribou coffees - the combination is terrific)

951,"	Nice Appearance, Poor Construction, and Good Coffee
	My wife and I selected the Krups FME-4 coffee maker to replace the Braun KF550-BK model we've used for the last 2 years.  The Braun was, and still is, an excellent machine.  But it lacked a timer, which the Krups has.

The Krups has a good clock/timer system that can be a little confusing, unless you read the manual (self-explanatory).  The display uses an LCD that can be difficult to view from some angles.  Overall, it works okay.

The construction of the Krups is what bothers me the most.  My Braun coffee maker has a filter holder that can stand upright on the counter while I'm filling it with grounds.  This is really useful.  Unfortunately, the filter holder for the Krups is not designed to stand on a counter, so I have to replace it in the coffee maker unit or hold it with my free hand while adding grounds.  This is a big annoyance.

Also, the review that mentions the uselessness of the water-level indicator on the side of the unit is completely accurate.  Bubbles form in the indicator, making it impossible to read.  Few things bother me as much as a feature that looks great on the packaging, and that's all.

Regarding the carafe, yes, it does spill; but, only if you try to pour too fast.  I had the same problem with my Braun, and just backing off on the angle of the carafe while pouring is enough to keep the coffee in the cup.

Overall, there are some critical design flaws that really shouldn't be present in such a frequently used product; but, it makes good coffee and is fairly simple to use.  In hindsight, I might have instead bought the Braun KF580-BK, which is identical to my current model plus a clock/timer

955,"	My 2 cents worth added to the debate!
	I pretty much agree with ILikeAmazon's review below.  This blender looks nice, sounds quiet and doesn't dance all over the kitchen when being used.  The lid stays put and it's easy to clean.  It also matches all my other small Kitchen Aid appliances.  Like others though, I make a smoothie every morning and I've had to learn how to use this blender for that.   First, it's helpful to let any frozen items sit for awhile in the blender (I load it as soon as I get water on for my coffee so it can sit until the last thing I do before leaving the house).  

If pushed for time, then I've found that putting the blender on pulse and constantly pulsing until the contents agitate on their own helps.  The problem is that either the funnel shaped bottom and/or the blades being turned in several directions pushes the frozen mush above the funnel shaped bottom of the blender.  Air enters the funnel shaped bottom and the mush calmly just sits above the blades.  At this point, the blender can be stopped and the mush gently pushed back down into the funnel before restarting the blender.  

Kitchen Aid products (and their customer service) are superior.  This blender is a nice addition to my kitchen.  As ILikeAmazon said:  ""There are always tradeoffs.""  I do hope however that they improve on the smoothie making capabilities of this powerful, attractive blender.  Then it will be a five star appliance.

By the way:  I like Amazon too!

	I was looking for a kettle with a handle that I could pick up without using an oven mitt, and one that doesn't require removal of the whistle (also with oven mitt of course) before pouring.  This kettle fit the bill.  The handle as well as the whistle are plastic and cool to the touch.  The whistle flips up with a touch of your thumb and does not require removal.

I have been pleasantly surprised by the kettle beyond the two features above (which I would have thought would be standard on every kettle, but that is so not the case).  It looks nice and is sturdily constructed.  The whistle is a gentle reminder, not a screaming alarm.  It holds a lot of water, enough for about 8 cups of tea plus a little water to rinse out/pre-heat the tea pot with.

My only suggestion for improvement is for the handle.  Because it's a straight bar across, it's not very ergonomic for pouring.  I often find my right wrist at a strange, almost uncomfortable angle.  I have solved the problem by using my left hand as well -- first I tilt the kettle with my right hand, then I use my left hand to hold the kettle while it's pouring.

So, their quality is less than it was; most people who ""grew up with Farberware"" may not realize this.

Also note: if you are buying a 12"" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section.

	We celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years. The Cuisinart TOB-50 is number 4. It's predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I'm optimistist. We choose it for it's simplicity, solid feel, and size hoping for reliability and ease of use. In it's early months it is meeting our expectations. It is one of the most solid and basic that I've seen on the market. The controls are solid and easy to use. It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily. My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you don't want to microwave. The door and the hinges are solid feeling. It is a nice size without being too bulky. We store it inside a cupboard so size was an important factor. It will toast 4 slices of bread or 4 to 6 waffles depending on their size. It has a soft bell to let you know when the heating cycle is done. The crumb pan is easy to use making the unit easy to clean. The only ""con"" I can think of in this unit is that the shelf does not pop forward when you open the door so you need a hot pad or shelf pull to pull it forward safely

	We had had this oven for a couple months when the door would no longer stay shut.  I tried jamming a wooden spoon against it to hold it shut while cooking, but found this sort of absurd.  So I called Cuisinart for warranty service.  They said they'd replace my oven with a new one, but I had to pay to ship the oven to their warehouse in NJ and it would take a few weeks.  In the meantime my husband found a set of little magnets at our local craft store, and fixed the problem!  So I wasn't going to ship the oven to NJ - until a replacement oven arrived...before I even sent the first one out.  Hmmmm.  

Anyway, we're enjoying this toaster oven very much and use it practically every day.  It is slower than a regular toaster, but cooks four pieces of toast/waffles all at once, so I figure its a fair trade.  It does a nice job with open-faced sandwiches or chicken nuggets for the kids on the broiler pan, without having to heat up our full-sized oven.  A practical choice especially for families with kids

	I love this thing!  Not only does it perform beautifully, but it's absolutely gorgeous.  I prefer to serve meals in it rather than one of my pretty platters.

I waited a pretty long time (almost a year) before writing my review to make sure I abused it enough.  This is my 2nd review.

Because it's well made, it's pretty heavy...that's why the ""helper handle"" is so helpful.  

We have a chicken salad about 4 times a week so I wanted a really big pan to be able to sear my chicken all at once without having to work in shifts.  

To clean and sanitize stuff, I put EVERYTHING in the dishwasher...vacuum attachments, toothbrushes, dog and cat toys etc...so the fact that this fits in my dishwasher is awesome for me.  I wash it by hand about 1/2 the time.  

The nonstick coating is wonderful...not a scrape or scratch on it.  Pay particular attention to cleaning the rivets (that might be the wrong terminology) that attach the handle to the pan on the inside.  The dishwasher gets all the icky stuff out of every crevice, but I use a soft dish brush for the rivets if washing by hand.

	I have owned this for years and LOVE it. The directions indicate that for 1 lb of coffee, you add 5 cups of water and let it sit (for hours). I actually add 9 cups of water and the coffee concentrate works just fine. I fill my ice cube trays with the coffee, then bag the cubes so that I can use it over time. It is delicious every time when you put the concentrate in a 3 to 1 ratio with water (American coffee) or less for stronger coffee (e.g., espresso). I particularly like to use these cubes for iced coffee -- it comes out nice and strong, not watered down.

A final bonus to the toddy maker: used coffee grounds are a folk remedy for fire ants. If you have them and you want them gone without throwing a bunch of chemicals in your garden. Put these atop their nest (but watch yourself!). They leave pretty quick.

1007,"	Don't bother with this model
	Read the description carefully. It states the speaker range is 50' not the microphone. My dog stood 10' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it wouldn't trigger. Matter of fact I never could get it to trigger with barking. The only time it did go off was when I put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand. Even then it didn't go off till I was about 4 feet from the mower.

I also couldn't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound. Even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise. Not just me but my husband too so it's not a case of super human hearing on my part :-)

Yes the timer option is very nice. This was actually why I purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking. But what good is the timer function if the microphone can't pick up the barking?

So read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units. Unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else.

1013,"	My continuing crusade against gizmos:
	There are a lot of theoretically good ideas that  fail when executed. This is one of them. 1/QUALITY:It's made cheaply, and even before it breaks, it's flimsiness does not inspire confidence. 2/RESISTANCE:The levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks,(many will be unchallenged right from the beginning). The standard: If the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue, you need more resistance. 3/COMPARED TO CRUNCHES: There's a reason why crunches are done lying down: The weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance, whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually  helps the effort, as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up. Much of what makes the Ab Crunch Machine 'work' is your weight dropping on it, not your muscles working. This little piece of plastic doesn't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides. (You may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect, but you can get -exactly- this effect, or -better-, without any equipment at all! Just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so.)... Of course, by the time a product is appealing to the public by  claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle  lying down (??) to do crunches is, we've reached the real problem: This thing is designed to AVOID EFFORT. It seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort. Unfortunately, exercise IS effort, and the more you avoid effort, the less exercise you get

	Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!

I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes  and  Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light

*Do NOT use distilled water. You can use tap water - if it's not too hard (less than 12 grains - who actually knows this?). Softened water can also cause problems. Basically, if you use anything except bottled water, expect problems!

*Empty the water from the iron after EVERY use. Failure to do so will result in leaking or spitting

*Other than the Rowenta Soleplate cleaning kits (which run about $12), the only instructions/recommendations for cleaning the soleplate are what NOT to  use.

1049,"	Almost useless
	Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.

There is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.  If there's only one problem - then why do I give it only one star?  Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife.  The 'eversharp' name I'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard ""wave pattern"" you'd see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.

I've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you're looking to stay in this price range, you won't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that's fine - the bread knife doesn't need to be strong like your chef's knife.

Pros:
-Cheap

Cons:
-Mashes your bread while it cuts
-Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness
-The 'spiky' serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread.

Suggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade

When they arrived, I noted that they were a bit lighter than the commercial quality cookie sheets that I had used previously, but my thinking was that if they baked well, that was all that counted.  I always bake with an Exopat silicone mat on my sheets.

Upon the first use, when they were placed in the oven, the edges of the cookie sheets turned up about a quarter of an inch - an ominous sign that the sheets are too thin.  The next thing I heard was the tap tap tap of sheets buckling in the oven.  Lack of dimensional stability at 350 degrees F translates to poor heat conduction, and burned cookie bottoms.  This symphony of metal buckling, courtesy of my new $15 cookie sheets.

Even with the Exopat silicone sheets on them, the cookies were barely done when I decided to pull them from the oven to save the bottoms from getting burned - typical of cheap, thin cookie sheets that one knows one needs to ""double pan"" to prevent burning.  What a wonderful situation Amazon has presented me with - $90 and a garbage can full of cookie sheets.

Yes, into the garbage all six sheets went - no matter how costly, its even more so to live with poor quality baking implements and invent work-arounds to augment their performance.  These are no better than inexpensive supermarket cookie sheets - actually they're worse - with the price-point of supermarket wares, one can infer the quality that one is getting.

I used to believe brands like Calphalon stood for quality, and this translated into some assurance that products bearing premium names would be of, at least, mezzanine quality.  When I buy on the web and cannot better scrutinize the items I'm choosing, I tend to favor trusted brands.  As it turns out, these sheets did not have the Calphalon name on them anywhere - Calphalon apparently made the decision to buy up a bunch of cheap -Made in China- cookie sheets and sell them at a premium price by leveraging the Calphalon brand.

With the holiday baking season upon us, what do I plan to replace them with?  The Vollrath cookie sheets (not non-stick, but I use silicone mats, so do I care?) recommended in Cooks Illustrated magazine.  They're in stock at Chef Resource - their price everywhere is $19 but most vendors are out of them.  They're due to arrive via UPS day after tomorrow - Tuesday, 10/17.  Holiday baking is much too sacred a tradition to be left in the hands of Calphalon, apparently.

If I could give them no stars or provide an icon of 6 sheets going into the trash, I would so rate them.

	You truly get what you pay for in this case.  We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house.  In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad.  They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend.

	I thought it was a good deal to order a ""Factory-Reconditioned"" Roomba 4210 Discovery to save some money, however...

It arrived!  I excitedly opened the box.  First impression...  The unit was dirty, very heavily scatched and scuffed.  Not exactly a good first impression.

I then lifted the Roomba out of the box and I was immediately covered with dirt and dust.  The bottom of the box was also filled with dirt and dust and hair.  I flipped it over and discovered the brushes covered with dirt, dust and someones (or somethings!) hair.

I was grossed out, but even worse, the other person in the room (who suffers from allergies) started to sneeze violently.  I spent the next 20 minutes thoroughly vacuuming the entire room and all other horizontal surfaces I could reach.

I think it is very obvious that NOBODY did anything with this Roomba since the previous owner returned it besides transfer the polystyrene packing box to a new cardboard box that says ""Remanufactured"" on it!

In summary - BE VERY CAREFUL!!!

If you ordered a ""Factory-Reconditioned"", be aware that it might be pre-filled with someone elses dust, dirt, hair and who knows what else.

I think I might have to bite the bullet and pay full price.  I like the idea of this product, but not the pre-filled one I received

	Well, I'm not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater.  Yes, it will grate cheese, but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1/4 of an inch.  This allows for the cheese to get 'gummed' up and eventually that large wad just falls through.  Also, for harder cheeses this means you're constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated.

I've yet to find a rotary grater I'm happy with.  I've broken several plastic models within 2 days of owning them.  While I've yet to break this metal model, it just doesn't perfrom very well.  I'm still using my stand-up grater

I tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh Parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on Jarlsberg.  Neither drum worked satisfactorily. That may be because it is made in China where hard western-style cheese is nearly unknown.  Yeah I  know it says MIU France but the box clearly says ""Made in China"".

	Discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use.  As a smoothie addict, shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily, I'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance (is a full year's use asking too much?).

The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it doesn't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons (always look for a single switch, a knob, or a touch-pad).  Otherwise, their shavers have served me better, mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes.

I'm going back to the beginning and giving the classic single-switch Oster another try, though I'm beginning to feel guilty about cluttering the landfills with more broken machinery and useless glass jars

1079,"	Unbiased review
	I use a blender to do two things: 1) make smoothies; and 2) stir batter for crepes.  

This device apprently cannot handle frozen fruit.  The white, plastic ""teeth"" on the bottom of the blades, that mesh / connect to the motor's ""teeth,"" immediately started breaking.  Three smoothies later only one plastic tooth remains and it is starting to fracture.  (My smoothies were made of yogurt, O.J., some frozen mango... nothing extreme.)

As far as the crepes go, even with only one ""tooth"" remaining, this baby still can stir eggs, milk, and a little flour (thank you for small miracles).  But... the glass jug is a dribbler.  When you pour batter or smoothies or whatever, some of the liquid will always (I mean always) dribble off the glass jug's lip, down the front of the jug, down the front of the control panel, and also into the recessed area where those ""teeth"" meet each other.  So... you have to clean ALL the blender each time you use it (i.e., the jug, the control panel, the recessed area in which the jug sets) not just clean the jug. What a pain in the neck.

Once the last tooth breaks, this baby is going in the garbage.

1085,"	Looks Great,  but...
	Tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice, I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently.  No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice (""rice cooker cup"")than it does for the water (""regular measuring cup""), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.
Yet another gripe is that it automatically goes into ""warm"" mode when it is finished. May be handy to have the warm option, but if you don't realize it's done and its left on ""warm"" for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab.
It seems very well made, and handsome Bau-Haus design, but unfotrtunately I can't use it because of the above problems. 

Others' experience may vary. Keep in mind I'm very good at ruining rice. I just don't need help doing it!

	The Black  and  Decker IC200 Arctic Twister Ice Cream Mixer is a product that you must not purchase. It is a total waste of money. It's designed to make soft-serve ice cream at home. The are not enpough pro's and way too many cons. the only Pro: It makes soft-serve ice cream when ever you want.
CONS
1. It's LOUD and Noisy
2. The ice cream you use in it must be as frozen as it is the second it comes out of the freezer which makes it very hard to scoop out.
3. If not used correctly, it make a huge mess.
4. It wastes ice cream. When you use this product, half of the ice cream gets stuck inside the machine.
5. by the time its finished, ice cream is pratically melted.
6. You ongly get about 1/3 of what you put in the machine. The rest gets stuck inside the machine.
7. You have to hold onto the on switch while operating the machine.
8. You have to hand pump the ice cream into soft-serve yourself. 
This Black  and  Decker IC200 Arctic Twister Ice Cream Mixer is such a waste of money. I So reccomend not buying this. Just going to Dairy Queen or Baskin Robins is a much easier and cleaner solutio

On a couple of occasions the sealer has worked without creating a vacuum. This time it appeared to be trying unsuccessfully to pull all the air out of the bag, but the bag never sealed.

	I have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother. She had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime. When I found the Kitchenaid cookie press on clearance for a mere $4.97 at my local Sears, I snatched it up with high hopes of recreating those fond childhood memories in the kitchen. 

It's not a bad cookie press, but it's definitely not the best out there, I'm sure...and it doesn't stack up at all to my mother's old-fashioned one. As stated in another review, many discs don't seem to work at all well with this press. I tried the tree, candy cane, and star discs and every single one just squirted out an uneven messy blob. Somehow the press pushed out the dough unevenly out of the press, so that one side of the shape was a blob while the other side was barely out of the press. 

The rosette, swirl, and ribbon shapes did fairly well, though they turned out much larger shapes than the older model I'm used to...hence extending the baking time of the cookies. I'm used to nice, thin, crispy ribbons, but this press turned out very thick ones. 

I was also not very fond of the ratcheting style of the press. It felt as though I had less control over it than the squeeze-gun type.

If I'd paid full price for this press, I would have been a bit upset at the quality, but having paid only $5 for it, I'm just disappointed because I had thought Kitchenaid to be a better quality brand than what I've seen in this cookie pres

1129,"	poor shipping, damaged pieces
	the furniture itself is fine. or rather, it would be if it was shipped properly. before ordering anything from target, think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return. if you receive something damaged (and you will), be prepared for an extensive return process. chances are, the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well. this happened to me twice. if you're lucky, you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments. this, however, will take time. additionally, even if the piece is not cracked, you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood. i bought the desk, the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain. 

also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier. after waiting and waiting, and calling target on several occasions, someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications. 

quite honestly, this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth. by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax, this is not so much a ""deal"" but a waste of time and money.

1130,"	A blender I wish I could like
	This blender is frustrating. It offers good points, but in the end, the flaws outweigh the benefits. First the good:

The heavy glass base is stable and easy to clean. The powerful motor hacks through most foods with ease. When the blender is started, the motor begins at a low speed for a second or two before turning on fully.

The problems I found led me to toss the blender. If you plan on making blended soups, beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on. Without a heavy hand on the lid, both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling. Moderately thick, viscous liquids (a lemon cream was the latest such one I experienced) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar. This leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended, while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy. Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area.

The above problems were annoying, caused occasional swearing, but  were tolerable. What finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse. After several years of moderate use, the KitchenAid stopped working. The blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth. These reduce operating noise, but over time, weaken. The problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries. A burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container. The rubber drive teeth slipped, and friction quickly heated them up. The result was hot, floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades. When this happens, it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use. Before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped

	I purchased the Robinson Pyrex Candy Thermometer as a replacement for my old, cheap tube thermometer that was giving off readings.
My experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius.  It would get there and just freeze.  

Additionally, the design of the thermometer makes it difficult to read exactly where your temperature is.  This makes it unsuitable for most candy-making where the difference of a degree or so could be critical.  

The physical design of the thermometer feels very sturdy and is a nice stainless.  It is rather deceptive since you think you may be purchasing a higher quality tool than you are actually buying.  

All said and done, after you replace the sugar, flavorings, creams and other ingredients from your spoiled batches of candy...and pay for the gas to run these errands ...the cost of using Robinson's Pyrex Candy Thermometer goes way up.

I was worried that the plastic storage was seeping toxins into my food when I washed it in the dishwasher. Also, I liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator--making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad.

Unfortunately, I have not been happy with this product. The Pyrex lids must be pried off with a great deal of strength and diligence. This is not a task for a child, or even a standard adult. I have had to ask my husband on more than one occasion to take a lid off for me. I have even spilled food in attempts to take lids off.  

As an aside, I have also found that the Pyrex glass is heavy, which makes it less desirable to carry leftovers to work AND the containers do not ""nest,"" so they take up more space than they need to in the cabinet.

I recommend Bormioli glass storage containers instead. They are lighter in weight, they nest, and the lids come off with the strength of a normal person.

The second order was dispatched immediately and sent via next-day. That was impressive. What was not impressive was that this time it was sent in an even *smaller* box, packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst. Naturally this set was also shattered.

Fortunately, I hadn't yet returned the first order, so I was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first set to complete the second. I'm sure their returns department won't like hearing that, but as I see it I've saved them the cost of a refund.

",0,"Some fractures may occur during transport. This sushi set is really beautiful. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't know how to ship ceramics properly. In my original order, they sent it in a medium-sized box, with bubble-wrap on one side only. Of course, some of the pieces were smashed. So I asked for a replacement via the return page. The second order was shipped immediately and shipped the next day. It was impressive. Not so impressive was that this time it was sent in an even smaller box, packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst. Of course, this set was destroyed, too. Fortunately, I had not returned the first order, so I was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first movement to complete the second. I'm sure your returns department won't like hearing this, but the way I see it, I've saved them the cost of a refund. Of course, I won't be ordering ceramic cutlery from Amazon any more.

	Well Im the newest victim of exploding pyrex.  Last night I was cooking some salmon in my 3-quart pyrex that I've had for 3 years and used many times before.  It was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes.  I pulled it out and set it on the counter.  Well I leaned in to check the salmon and as I pulled away the glass exploded! Not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere.  Thankfully I pulled away when I did because if I had pulled away 2 seconds later I would have had a face full of Pyrex shrapnel. I came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach...and from what I've heard I was lucky.  Even though my boyfriend and I swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light I could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen.  Im not taking any chances, Im throwing out my other Pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays.  Please DO NOT USE PYREX! It is not worth the risk! You may have a few years of good use, but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children?
Edit- I would just like to comment that I was using the dish within the guidelines. The oven was 400 and the dish was only in there for 25 minutes.  The kitchen was rather warm and the surface I set it on was not hot but definately not cool...so there was no drastic temperature change.  There were no scratches or cuts any where on the tray so I do not feel that the explosion was in anyway my fault. This explosion was purely the result of a poorly manufactured item

	I bought this because it was well priced, good sized and looked better than many other slow cookers. I assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that I gave away. The first time I used it (as soon as it got up to tempurature) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top.

At first I thought maybe I was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid. Now I realize this is the way it was designed! I made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid. The only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly,tumbly,bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter. Not to mention its probably a fire hazard. I don't think my paper towel idea is what Rival had in mind when they designed this! I wish I could return this but I threw away the receipt.

1193,"	Poor quality coffee
	This machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned European-style coffee drinker (coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean, not a tall cup of Sanka as the term is used in the US). Admittedly, I'm really picky about my coffee, but $250 for this machine is ridiculous. I've had coffee from a $40 Krups machine that is better than that made by the EspressoPro. I use high-quality pods with this machine (Molinari, Lucaffe, and Miscela d'Oro) which guarantees consistency in other machines, but doesn't help with this machine. Here are my issues with the machine. 

1. The thermoblock isn't effective. I HAVE to put water in my espresso cup and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds before making an espresso or else my coffee will be lukewarm. Disgusting, even with high quality beans. Granted, unless your machine has a cup warmer, this is probably a good idea regardless of your machine, but with this machine, it is a REQUIREMENT, not an option, if you want hot coffee. 

Second, steamed milk is lukewarm on a good day. The same heating problem occurs with steaming milk. I called Capresso, and they said to check all the fittings. In fact, after much frustration (I'm not an idiot), I finally just sealed the connections with shrink tube, which leaves only two points where the connection could be weak. Still, I can't get HOT steam. What I do get is either lukewarm liquid milk, or cool, overly thick foam. In fact the foam is so unrefined and thick that it gives the impression that you could chew it. Nasty. 

2. The frothing mechanism is gimmicky and not effective. A standard ""frothing wand"" is much better. The mechanism on this machine is ineffective, lacks true control, and requires an extra step over a standard wand to clean. 

As explained above, the heat is not sufficient, and the quality of foam is irregular and bad. I'm embarrassed to serve coffee from this machine to guests, let alone drink it myself. I just can't get over the heat issue. Nothing kills a good coffee than lack of heat. This point is so important, if you take a gander at the Francis! Francis! X1 (and professional machines), there's a thermometer right on the front of the machine (and no, it's not purely an esthetic design issue since you can put several types of gauges/switches on an espresso machine--like a pressure gauge). The low heat generated results in really thick, solid foam. When I have guests, I just heat milk on the stovetop and use a handfrother instead of using the EspressoPro's lame mechanism. 

Second, the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective. A little gate is regulated by the user through a twisting tab. It's just not good design. Since the milk actually passes through the machine and is heated internally by the machine, you can't really ""work"" the milk. A wand offers direct control and offers immediate visual response to whether you're getting foam or hot milk. 

You know dried milk that collects on your steaming wand? Well, that's now inside your EspressoPro. With a traditional wand, you just wipe the wand with a wet rag. With this machine, you need to run hot water through the frothing mechanism (BEFORE you do this you need to wait for the block to heat up again). Plus, there's so many little pieces that need to be kept clean, it's a pain. What a bad design! 

3. 18 Bar? Yeah, right. This machine also doesn't generate enough pressure to develop nice crema. Granted, I use pods, but still, a certain amount of crema is expected. This machine produces a thin, insufficient amount of crema. The lack of sufficient pressure probably has to do with the poor thermoblock. 

I really can't recommend this machine. For $250, just go get a Krups or Braun. Better yet, spend $50 more and get an entry level Gaggia or Saeco. With this machine you're paying for looks and a gimmicky, ineffective frothing mechanism. This hunk o' junk is now buried deep in the back of my kitchen cabinet, as I truly would not feel right pawning this machine off on someone else. It is now appropriately ""retired"" from service, and I now enjoy perfect coffee every day from my Saeco Vienna Superautomatica. Now that's a machine, baby

1197,"	Leaks coffee while brewing 8 out of 10 times
	As another reviewer experienced, our Krups also leaks coffee all over the counter and subsequently the floor quite often, which is apparently related to having to have the carafe situated in just exactly the right place within a half a millimeter, and which place I have not yet discovered except occasionally by chance.  Carafe positioning appears to be the problem, because it doesn't leak every time.  Maybe my unit is defective, because other reviewers don't mention this, and believe me, you would notice this if it were occurring with yours. 

The opening to pour in water is relatively small, but I don't have a huge problem with it. Be aware there is no automatic shut off.  It makes a fine cup of coffee for this non-coffee-gourmet, and I don't have a problem with spilling when I pour from the carafe into a cup.  But the leaking is forcing me to find another machine.  

I wish I could find a reasonably-priced, non-leaking 12-cup machine with removable water reservoir, no-drip carafe, programmable, auto shut-off, easy-to-find replacement carafe and removable filter basket but alas, even on amazon.com, that machine does not appear to exist.

Henckel, cutco, trident are expensive and chefs all over the world use them because the are used everyday and they retain their sharpness because they are tempered 7 times (the maximum amount before metal becomes so hard that it becomes brittle) 

Wood is pourus and is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria. You don't just wipe off knives and put them in a wood butcher block? What moran came up with that great concept? Utensils need to be sterilzed through a dish washer and very hot water with good cleaning agents. 

Why woould you buy a knife that you can't put in the dish washer? Why would you ever purchase a knife that requires maintenance. There's no moving parts

Wood handle and stainless steel spells disaster. Learning to sharpen your own knives is not easy, chefs don't even do it. Reading direction from a pamphlet and attempting to sharpen your knives for the first time spells disaster. Your knives will never be the same if you attempt this. Companies sell sharpening tools to inexperienced knife sharpeners (like yourself) so they wreck their own knives and buy new.

You should only buy one pair of knives in your lifetime and they can be handed down from generation to generation. 

A dull knife is a dangerous knife. A dull knife will require more pressure which will lead to a person cutting themselves.

	cThis is my second bread maker. I bought Cuisinart's one last year and had used it for about a year. I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point.

Cuisinart's one has obviously some problems:
 1. Bread tends to be darker so quickly and becomes hard.
 2. It is very noisy during kneading cycle as I can not hear the music from the audio.
 3. Paddle is caught in the bread and hard to remove it if you do not remove it before baking cycle starts.
 4. Some basic cycle have no ""Pre-heat"" cycle. It means I need to prepare exactly appropriate temperature water to make yeast work nicely. But it is very hard and sometimes I fail.
 5. The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients are left on the corners and baked as it is if I do not mix it using a spatula.

One of my friends owns Panasonic bread maker and showed it to me. I was so surprised at it as the thickness of the case is very different. She has never had such a problem which I have had. Then I decided to get Panasonic one although my first one is still working. The bread maker was delivered in 2 days. I tried same recipe which I often used for Cuisinart's. The bread came out amazingly nice and much nicer than the one from Cuisinart. Bread is nicely blown, crispy outside and soft, fluffy inside. It is just perfect. I guess these difference come from mainly these things:
 1. The case is very thick so that bread can not be brown so quickly and keep the inside of bread soft and flavorful.
 2. ""Pre heat"" cycle adjust the temperature of water well. I do not have to make appropriate temperature's water any more.
 3. This machine has the special room for yeast. It works very well to keep yeast away from the water particularly using the timer.

I think I never back to Cuisinart although I miss some points (Sophisticated design or the window on the rid which I can see inside of the case through) of Cuisinart a little bit. I highly recommend this bread maker.
",0,"I switched to Panasonic cThis, which is my second bread machine. I bought Cuisinarts last year and used them for a year. I had no idea how different each bread maker was at that point. Cuisinarts one obviously has some problems: 1. Bread tends to darken and become hard so quickly. 2nd It is very loud during the kneading cycle, as I cannot hear the music from the audio. 3rd Paddle is trapped in bread and difficult to remove if not removed before the baking cycle. 4th Some basic cycles do not have a ""pre-heating cycle."" This means that I have to prepare just the right water at a temperature to make the yeast work well. But it's very hard and sometimes I fail. 5th The design of the case is not great. Some unmixed ingredients stay at the corners and are baked as it is if I do not mix them with a spatula."

1245,"	Not as good as it seems
	I bought this rack thinking that I can now bake cakes with bigger size, or cool a bunch of cookies on the same rack; well...I am very disappointed. But let's start witht he good things first.

PROS:
1. It's big, I like the size a lot
2. It's gridded, so I don't need to worry about cookies falling off the rack. They are steady right there.

CONS: 
The biggest problem is the material, it is not strong at all!

When the rack arrived, the middle of it was already bent (or sagging a bit). I was able to bent it backwards easily, yet that ""perfect"" posture didn't hold for long, it's back to its bad sagging position again very soon.

Then it got way worse, when I try to cool cakes on it. Cookies aren't that bad, since they are light. When I have the moist and right out of the oven cake sitting on that rack, the middle of the rack is barely touching my kitchen counter top already. Of course, as soon as I lift my cake up, it goes back to the normal sagging position.

I think unless you are planning on baking cookies only...this is not a rack for you. Pick something else, something stronger

1247,"	Poorly designed lid
	This is a gorgeous ice bucket. It is large and stylish.  However, I cannot recommend it because of the lid.  The lid is attached to the bucket and does not come completely off.  Instead, it pivots and swings up.  The problem with this is that you cannot fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing.  And, because the lid is not removable, it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne/wine cooler.  Poor design flaw.  I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I don't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way. You'll notice in OXO's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up.  Why?  Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way.  Hey OXO, that's the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar! 

Would it have killed OXO to put a knob/handle on the lid and let the customer decide if they want the lid on or off? I swear sometimes I think manufacturers never bother actually testing out the things they design. If they had, surely they would have noticed how bad their lid idea was.  Or they could have looked at every other ice bucket on the market to see that theirs is the only one in which the lid doesn't come off.  That should have been a clue to them that there are obvious merits to having  a removable lid.

This bucket has a clear plastic lid.  I don't understand why it's plastic at all.  First of all, it's an ice bucket!  I think everyone knows ice is inside without needing to peek through the lid.  Secondly, a metal lid will keep the temperature inside colder longer than than a plastic lid. That is why the bucket is made of metal, not plastic.  Metal is a better conductor of heat and cold. 
 
I wish I had noticed the lid before I purchased it.  I didn't pay close enough attention. I suppose I assumed it was a normal lid that came off like all the others.  Thankfully I got the bucket from my local Bed Bath  and  Beyond making its return very easy.  I am sorry I have to return it  because this really is a nice looking bucket. However, I don't intend to spend $40 on an ice bucket just to sit there, look pretty and receive compliments--that's my job as hostess :-).  I want an ice bucket that is functional too.  

Oh, well...my search for the perfect ice bucket continues.

I read the instructions front to back, allowed it to charge the full amount of time, and I was pretty excited when it came time to try it out.  Right from the start, I knew it was junk.  You are supposed to be able to lift the piece of plastic up and have it stay in the up position while you change the blade.  Not mine.  The plastic piece kept coming off, and dozens of tries to keep it upright resulted in dozens of failures.  I decided to look past that and judge purely on the shredding ability.  Once I started trying to grate, I had a really hard time getting the thing to shred.  I tried varying degrees of pressure.  As others commented, the cheese does get stuck EVERYWHERE.  Then, the cheese that does come out is in tiny little shreds.  I did not get the nice big shreds that I am used to with my manual grater.  My husband thought I was doing it wrong, so he tried it.  He had the same result.  I will not even sell this at a rummage sale or give it to goodwill, because people are better off without it.  Since it was a gift, I'm glad I'm not out any money.

1300,"	What a Disappointment
	I used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust. The surface is fragile and hard to clean. I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. 

Just to clarify--the mat was used to line an airbake cookie sheet for the pizza and to line a baking pan with the roast atop of a bed of carrots and celery. I like my pizza crisp yet moist so I reheat it in a skillet when I can. I bake thin or drier pizza on an insulated sheet to keep it from getting desiccated. When I make a roast--I don't need any gravy. I slow roast the Alton Brown way and the juice stays in the meat rather than ending up in the bottom of the pan. The meat literally makes its own au jus in your mouth. I put a bed of vegetables on the bottom to further reduce the heat transfer from the pan to the meat.  Not cooking for a crowd?  Try a 3 inch thick steak (stood on end) cooked this way. You won't want to share. I don't slow roast turkey but it only takes 2-1/2 hours to do a 14-16 pound bird if you temper it properly. My sister always gets comments on how moist and juicy it is. 

In fairness, when I gave my neice two of my unused large pastry/baking mats, she used them successfully to make her chocolate dipped strawberries, turtles, etc.

	Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. 

While you learn how to not get scalded, this kettle is always at least slightly irritating.  There are better kettles around

1312,"	Tried it, hated it, returned it
	I needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch.  I had read other reviews of the Bissell Little Green Machine that were unfavourable, so headed off to the store to find something else . . . . the Atlantis Express looked interesting, and I hadn't seen it before.

Suffice to say, it did get the cat stains out of the couch, but not after revealing itself as a really poorly designed product.

- The machine is LOUD, very loud
- The cleaning 'head' on the end of the hose has a 'flip-up' cover to make it easier to clean where it sucks in lint and stuff into the machine.  That is a great idea, but there is no gasket to make the joints true and tight . . .. so while it may have 2 times the power of other machines based on sheer power of the motor, it looses some of this power when you actually use it to try and suck water and cleaning solution back up.
- The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine.  However to accomplish this, the cleaning head has 2 seperate spayers on the underside.  Neither are centered, the one on the left operates when you have the slider set to solution and the one to the right operates when you have slider set to rinse.  As they are not centered, they overspray quite a bit past the edge of the cleaning tool. Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 inches past the edge of the cleaning head.  To top it off, when you release the trigger, the cleaning head continues to drip water for a few moments, meaning that you have to go VERY slowly or risk dripping everywhere.

While it functioned well enough to clean my couch, it was a brutal and terrible experience.  When I bought it I figured it could be used too on my car interior . . . . but the frustration of cleaning a small patch on my couch quickly quelled that thougt.

I returned the Atlantis Express to the store and went out and bought a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. -- which I should have done right from the start--- the hoover runs circles around this machine

To achieve this, the cleaning head has 2 separate arms on the bottom. Neither device is centered, the left device works when the slider is set to solution, and the right one when the slider is set to flush. Since they are not centered, they spray quite far past the edge of the cleaning device. Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 cm behind the edge of the cleaning head."

	I've had two of these now, and they both had one serious flaw: the trumpeted ""brew and pause"" feature DOES NOT WORK.  Pull the carafe out during brewing and treat yourself to a steaming hot waterfall of coffee that would almost be comical if it weren't such a relentless pain in the neck to clean up.
Also, it's hard not to spill some water on the heating plate, either during filling or brewing, creating a consequent sizzling sound that adds a lot of ambience -- if you live in a steak house.
Considering how many other coffee makers are available out there, these flaws make this machine a mistake.
Too bad, because some things are done quite nicely: the controls are good and easy to set, and the overall styling is sleek, euro-cool, and compact.  Unless you live in a community where calcified sewage runs through the taps, the water filters do about as much as a rain dance.

We also like the mixer very much in terms of its function, so we used another mixer. This time the same thing happened, except that the collar burst within 2 weeks!! My other complaint is that I found Waring Customer Service disinterested and unhelpful - especially because I contacted them about buying a new model, not about problems with the one we had. I saw a model on their website, but no purchase information was listed; I emailed to find out where to buy, and the representative seemed almost uncomfortable by my request"

1331,"	Reliability is the Issue
	Unfortunately, I've ordered more than my share of FoodSaver products, having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage,  despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers.

What many of them claim is very much to the point: plastic containers frequently develop cracks and loss of vacuum.  I've had many of their marinators and storage canisters prove defective after less than 10 uses.  It seems to be related to the material properties and container size characteristics.  The smaller containers seem to last longer. Those with thick walls relative to the specified volume or reinforcing structures seem to last just a bit longer.

In plain language, the plastic containers are unreliable.  FoodSaver should develop materials and designs that can handle the stress of the vacuum cycling placed on them, or quit the the business.  Since their products have been on the market for many years, I can only assume they are more interested in recruiting new customers than satisfying existing customers. If you like filling out warranty forms every few weeks, more power to you.

Bottle sealers are equally worthless.  Every one that I bought lost vacuum in short order.  In one case, a defective seal resulted in a spill of cooking oil that damaged a nylon tent and other camping gear.

FoodSaver has done a good job with certain items in their product line.  The vacuum unit is well designed and performs reliably, as long as the instuctions are followed.  The bagging system is unassailable, even though the cost of the bags and rolls is quite high (read Consumer Reports reviews).  And, to be fair, their Universal lids are excellent.  Use them to seal  small glass jars or stainless steel bowls, and there is no loss of vacuum due to cracked plastic.

Bottom line?  Be careful which products you buy.  Some are excellent, while others are pure junk.

Then when it would not work one morning just a little over two years after I bought it I called them again.

into the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.

small. Needless to say I returned the litter box and was so glad to

1403,"	Bad idea if you are thinking cheesecakes
	I thought the four 4.5 inch springform pans would be equivalent to one 9.0 inch springform pan.  After all, the areas are equal, i.e. 4 * 2.25 * 2.25 * pi == 4.5 * 4.5 * pi.  I thought I could use the recipe for a 9-inch cheesecake and have 4 4.5-inch cheesecakes that tasted the same but were a more convenient size for giving as gifts.  

However, while the areas are the same, the volumes are not.  The pans are not deep enough.  While a 9-inch springform pan is 3 inches deep, these 4.5-inch springform pans are 1.5 inches deep.  Therefore, if you use the recipe for a 9 inch cheese cake, you have a lot of batter left over.  If you half the recipe, you produce baked goods that taste something like cheesecake but not as dense or as moist or as rich.

I was very disappointed in these pans.  They may be good for something, but I don't know what.  They are well-made, so I won't throw them away, but right now I feel like they were a waste of money

	I bought this back in 1999, and I love the way it cooks chicken and salmon steaks, but it's not built to last.  First, after about 3 years, the tracks where the door slips onto the bottom broke off due to the screws being too tight, and then the 5th year, the knob broke off, so I have to use pliers to turn it on.  It still cooks chicken great, but after trying to superglue the ""feet"" back on and the knob, they broke again right away.  

Cleaning is a pain, and the non-stick stuff got scraped right off. The food tray that goes on top is hard to clean too.

 Don't try to cook burgers in the basket, because they shrink as the fat drips out, no matter how tight you make the basket, and they start sliding around and falling apart as they hit each other. 

Cooking times were always longer than the cookbook says.  

I used the skewers once to cook some ribs, and they're so flimsy, that they kept falling off the spit from the weight of the ribs.

I still use it, but I wouldn't buy a 2nd one after reading all the reviews.  I think I'll try a George Foreman one next time

1417,"	Buyer beware!
	When I first bought this pan I was replacing a pan from a moderately priced set from Costco.  That pan lasted about 3 years and I got my money's worth.

The positive review from America's Test Kitchen is what pointed me in this direction.  The Farberware pan was a joy to use when I first bought it and I loved the even heat.  All of the positive comments are accurate at first.

The problem is it only lasted 3 months before it lost it's nonstick properties almost completely.  I never used spray on oil or subjected it to high heat.  I was always very meticilous about the way I cleaned it and never touched the surface with anything but plastic.  I even bought a special soft plastic cleaning brush so as to be very delicate with the surface.

I have been using nonstick skillets since they first came out many years ago.  With the exception of one ultra cheapo model I have NEVER had a nonstick that had its nonstick go bad so quickly.  Of course I can send this back to Farberware but it seems clear that if it has lost it's nonstick properties they only have to say it was my fault.  Why waste $10 in shipping costs?  This is my last Farberware product.

After writing this first part of the review I thought it would only be fair to email Farberware to let them respond.  After doing some googling I have found that there is no email.  It is also basically impossible to get someone on the phone.  They sold their warranty service to a different company, All American Lighting in Berwick, PA.  As it turns out this company gets terrible feedback for their service.  If this isn't really Farberware what exactly is their incentive to provide good service?  You can check on consumeraffairs dot com and other places and you'll get an eyeful.  BUYER BEWARE

On either speed, it just seems to chop what is in the center, so the stuff on the inside stays on the inside and the outside stuff stays on the outside--unchopped.  If I wanted to take the lid off every two seconds and move everything around, I'd use the blender, no?  I nearly pureed some red pepper, trying to get it all chopped.  I have a 2 cup mini chopper (Procter-Silex, I think) that is really much better at consistent chopping.  I never had to take the top off of it.  Unfortunately, the bowl got warped in the dishwasher (even though it claimed to be dishwasher safe) and the lid does not fit tightly now, making an occasional mess with liquids and crumbs.  Still, even warped, I find myself using the old one instead of this new one--it is really that bad!

	I brought T-fal pans from my local Sam's Club wearhouse, and initially, the pans worked great. this is my review after about 1.5 years of use:

1. the handle on the lid (plastic) broke after about a year. 

2. the non stick coating began to crack from regular use in about about 6 month, and it got so bad that i tossed the pan out in about a year and half. 

3. the handle broke twice on me and for both time i super glued them back on. on the third time, i just tossed them out and got an expensive Anolon titanium non-stick set. 

4. the pan is not made of aluminum and there are ""hot / cold"" spots on the pan. the hot / cold spot is caused by uneven distribution of heat. a good pan, generally with copper or aluminum core will evenly distribute heat. this pan does not. 

bottom line: 

do not use this pan in the oven eventhough the instruction said up to 400 degrees. the handle will and did crack on me for 3 times with occasional oven use.

the pan is thin, and does not distribute heat well. and the worst: the non-stick coating is a joke. 

i found out that it's actually cheaper to get a expensive set and use it for like 10 years instead of getting a cheap set for a third of the price and replace it every 2 years or less.

	I honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.  

I use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn't be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It's done.  What an incredible dissappointment.

But, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool(?).  First, my dishwasher broke (3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer's seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re-routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues (loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.

I did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don't make much of anything.  Everything is just a re-branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.

I really wish they'd go back to their original smooth enamel finish. This must be an attempt to produce an interior more durable for using metal utensils with. An attempt that in my opinion is a failure. Things (like eggs and hamburgers) stick to this finish. You have to use a lot more fat to prevent sticking. It's hard to get clean, takes quite a bit of scrubbing even after soaking. It doesn't give the finish to grilled meats, etc that I want from a fry pan. Forget deglazing it to make a sauce. I find my All Clad 9 inch skillet to be a superior performer to this one.

Since this is a 9 inch skillet, I haven't used it to saute onions, etc., so I can't say how it performs with these items. 

I do use it to make cornbread and to roast small portions of meats or veg in the oven, with good results (as long as I'm not going to use the browned bits to make a sauce). This to me though, is not enough uses to justify buying it.

While the company has been more than understanding, I hesitate to call again because I don't even want another one.  Getting my money back shouldn't lie with the hands of the seller I purchased it from.

Here's the problem.  After a week of use, the water and grounds kept spilling over and coffee was not draining into the pot, saturating the electric plate and my kitchen floor. When I could get it just right (standing there holding the carafe in place), the coffee tasted burnt. 

I thought I had a defective product, but the new one is starting to do the same thing. The carafe does not stay in place and slides forward when placed on the electric plate (until there is enough coffee dispensed. The coffee carafe is supposed to push (when it's in the right place) on the plastic piece that releases the coffee.  It's a design problem.  It's definitely cheaply made. I have to stand next to my coffee maker as it's brewing to make sure the coffee is dripping. 

Believe me, I wouldn't have bothered writing this if I didn't think it might save someone else the headaches. Buy something else! It's not worth the hassle.

	I love Kitchenaid products, but this one failed miserably!!
The taste of the coffee is excellent, but there were grounds and coffee everywhere.  The Pause N Serve feature works as it brews!!  I don't think that was the intention though.  When I called the company the not so brilliant guy told me that they hear this all the time on this model and that you just have to push the coffee maker in far enough so that the pause n serve feature isn't activated...well, unless we put a heavy ceramic bowl in front of the carafe to hold the pot in place we have coffee soup all over our counter and floor.  

My husband and I love coffee and we like it STRONG!  We feel coffee is very important to survival in our home as we have 5 kids and this helps us stay alive and energetic for the 48 hours a day we care for them!!  

My strong advice...don't but this model.  Though Kitchenaid is a great product and I have never had problems with any of their other lines, this one should be junked!  We are returning ours!

	The salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls, that the new KitchenAid was sure to be a huge improvement, especially with it's price tag.  We've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages.  The manual's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this.  Also, we've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out.  For the price tag, this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker.  We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model (NOT KitchenAid).  Oddly enough, our other KitchenAid appliances (range and fridge) have also had electronic problems.  I wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured, no doubt, in some overseas location.  I wouldn't recommend KitchenAid to anyone, regardless of the nice styling and supposed high-quality.

1504,"	Water  and  Steam Everywhere!
	This Krups espresso maker leaves water and steam all over the counter every time it is used. I think the ""built in safety"" features are to blame. The finer the grind, the more water leaked out. Keep in mind that fine grinds are recommended for espresso and cappuccino.

Using a coarse grind, which is usually only used for cowboy coffee out on the trail or French press machines, I still get quite a bit of leakage. Using finer grinds produces more and more leakage leaving only about half a carafe of extremely strong espresso which is indeed more like cowboy or french press coffees. -I enjoy cowboy coffee but would prefer espresso from my espresso machine plus I hate all the mess.

The Krups machine I had fifteen years ago worked well but this machine sucks big time. If you don't want to fork over a lot of bucks for a ""real"" espresso maker, try a Mr Coffee espresso machine. Mine, which I use when I travel, cost less than twenty dollars and does not leak.

In the meantime I have ordered a Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker to replace the Krups. -I'll keep you postsed.

I started looking for places to store it so that it wouldn't wake me up at night or disturb me with it's annoying hum first thing in the morning. But I didn't have to worry, but the next morning the batteries were dead. I replaced them and within 24 hours they were all dead again!  There is no place to plug it in so you're stuck with using batteries. I'm going to try buying rechargables but I don't know how long I'm going to want to keep this replacement going!!

1509,"	Pricey for an item that's $19, isn't it?
	Recommended:
No.  The product is not very durable


Good things:
All in all, this caddy is great because it's versatile. It's huge and tall enough so a 12.5"" round cake that's about 5 inches high can fit in easily. The locking mechanism is also pretty neat. There's 3 of them so it makes it very easy to carry without any fuss of the cake dropping on the floor. The handle of the carrier also gives a comfortable grip.  Carrier is also see through so you'll notice if the decorations have been messed up during the transporting process.

NOT so Good things:
NOT very durable. Locking mechanism that holds the base of the carrier may crack making it non portable.
This product is susceptible to breakage perhaps because certain stores just have had these items on their shelf for a long time-- that's only my assumption. Plastic should not crack unless it's placed in extreme temperatures or is abused. Should the temperature in the fridge crack a plastic? Very unlikely don't you think?
The price is also far cry compared to other products sold by discount stores (i.e Linens../WlMrt. Other carriers are sold from $4-$9.

The height is good but it can be problematic when storing it in the fridge, but aren't all cakes difficult to store regardless?

In terms of cleaning the base, you'll need a brush to really get the bottom cleaned up

	I have used the steamer once, and was disappointed at how long it took. The steam comes out weakly and splattered water on the garment several times. I was just trying to take the store creases out of a new pair of lightweight cotton trousers, and it took a lot of going over to get it done. I used to have a small hand steamer that put out a real blast of steam and worked much faster. This one will probably work on heavier material like drapes, but it will take a very long time. I wouldn't buy it if you plan to use it for anything other than very delicate items, and it seems like a lot of equipment to lug out for that job. A hand unit makes more sense to me, and you wouldn't have to maneuver that long hose. This is just one more large thing to store. I wish I could return it to Wal-mart, but will probably give it away and buy something that is easier to use

	I hate to iron and despise the cost of dry cleaning...so, I was really excited when I saw this steamer at CVS.  It was reasonably priced and sounded wonderful.  I was bragging about how much I loved this steamer after using it just once!  It was easy and fast....then, the second time I used it---Water everywhere!  

Water started to spit and spray out of the (sealed and closed) base of the steamer.  I had turned the top to the locked position...but, the black rubber ring (supposed to keep the thing sealed?) was all twisted up---explaining why it wasn't working.  Well, I fixed that rubber thing back into place, but it still kept spraying boiling water.  SO, right now it's sitting in the corner waiting to be thrown out.  

I'm very frustrated with this product, but love the way that clothes steamers work.  It looks like I'm going to have to bite the bullet and buy an expensive one.  But, how expensive should these things be?  All they do is boil water and shoot it out of a nozzle, right?

This product is a waste of time and money...I can't believe that there were any good reviews.

1536,"	A Big Fat Joke  and  A Waste Of Money
	I am a trained research assistant; therefore, I try to research products before I purchase them.  In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it.  I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice.  On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money.  The problems I had were:

1.  The cord is too short: directions instruct user to hang nozzle on the door hook which hangs over the top of any door.  The nozzle would not reach to the top of the door, and I live in a mobile home, so it is not like I have the tallest doors in a home.

2.  The most important thing in steaming a garment, for me, is to avoid the garment getting wet.  I did not fill the steamer to the maximum line, because I know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect.  After 2 minutes of waiting for the steam, I began to try it out on a silk blouse, and what a big mistake I made.  The water spat out on the material.  I thought that I should not hold the nozzle so close, but it did not matter, because water continued to spit out on the blouse.

3.  The steam pressure would not dewrinkle the blouse.  The is not a case where the material was so hard to dewrinkle; it is silk, not that hard of a material.

I have read other reviews, and if this machine worked for them, I don't know how, but I can attest to the operation of the steamer that I purchased.  I dabble in selling clothing on another website, and I have owned my other steamer since 2002, and I will continue to use it; I will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home.  Conair GS4 Compact is a bust.

I checked if there was something that had melted when I boiled the water, but I saw the kettle was intact. I boiled more water and again I saw the black goo floating in the water.

This machine has been terrible, when you put water in it the filter part floats up and out of the slot letting water get into the machine unfiltered. When your filling your cup you have to bend down in front of the machine to see where the coffee is in the cup or it will overflow, making more for you to clean up. I just want coffee!!!

Even though the inside ""unit"" that holds the coffee does come out, it is not designed to fit into the front of a refrig to put water in it. You have to use something else to catch the water from the refrig then dump that into this machine. 
They put little time into the design/research of this machine.  I hesitate to add this as I don't want anyone reading this to think my home is dirty....living in Florida we tend to see Palmetto bugs. This machine has about 5 vent holes in the top of it, I had two bugs get in the machine. They had full access to the water reservior. Once I filled the water reservior the bugs came flying out.

1561,"	No Need for Cups, Slurp It Off the Counter
	We received the Hamilton Beach BrewStation 12 Cup Coffeemaker as a gift from my sister-in-law.  She loved hers and had used it for a few months so she bought one for us.  Shortly after buying this for us, her coffeemaker started leaking.  She thought it was just worn out from the six months of use and purchased a different type to replace hers.

We used our BrewStation for the first time yesterday.  The night before, I set it up and programmed it to make coffee at 5:00 AM - perfect, we could get up and have coffee already made.  It worked great.  A minor problem is that I enjoy coffee throughout the morning and the coffeemaker shut off after two hours.  Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, I just turned it back on and life was good.

Now before I go on with my story, I need to explain how this coffeemaker works.  You pour the water into the first reservoir (for water only) using the coffee tank to measure the amount of water.  The coffee tank is placed back on the coffeemaker and the coffee filter and coffee is placed in a basket that fits on top of the coffee tank.  The coffee is made and held in the coffee tank.  To dispense the coffee, you place your cup below the tank and push on the dispenser button with your cup.  Coffee pours right into the cup.  Great idea, too bad it doesn't work as well as the concept!

Today coffee was brewed at 5:00 AM again.  That's the only thing that worked well.  When my husband tried to get a cup of coffee it poured out and would not stop.  The cup overflowed, the coffee ran all over the counter and continued to flow until he unplugged it and put the entire coffeemaker in the sink.  It finally stopped pouring out when it ran out of coffee.  I've cleaned the coffee tank and it continues to pour no matter what I do.  Since this coffeemaker runs just under $ 50, the twelve cups of coffee we've made with it very expensive!

I've emailed Hamilton Beach and am awaiting an answer to this dilemma.  I need to purchase another coffeemaker today and it definitely won't be a Hamilton Beach brand.  I can't afford to purchase a new coffeemaker every other day!

My advice is to purchase a different brand and stay away from this one.  Unless you don't have cups and want to slurp your coffee off of the counter!

The bad is: the tread that hold the cap is inside the conteiner so when you mix, the mixture go thru the tread (it doesn't look nice), and it's supposed to be hold in by a clear tiny silicon-like band that is attached to the cap. If you tighten the cap too much, the band will be squeezed out of position and leak. If you do not tighten it enough the band won't seal and leak.
Another thing, maybe not as important as the above, is that it is little uncomfortable to drink directly from the bottle, the lid keep closing everytime.

As many times as hubby and I try to clean this its become too much of a pain, this coffee pot is out of here... and on its way to the curb.

The water receiver only accepts water when the iron is laying flat. Well, that's fine if the iron isn't hot, but what if you decide you need water while ironing? The steam controls either don't work on the unit I have, or they don't work similar to any other iron I've used.

	First of all I'm a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).

At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the ""dirt container"" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me ""Hoover"" spells ""DISAPPOINMENT""

	This is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had! It has continually broken down since I bought it and is now again dead. It's only 1 1/2 years old! While under warranty (the first year), I went through 5 belts, a roller brush, and the motor burned out. It is no longer under warranty, and of course, it broke down again. It smokes like it's on fire, and I believe that it's the roller brush *again*. Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don't have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week. I complained to Hoover and they basically told me ""too bad"". And it's not like it's an inexpensive vacuum at $289!

	The Breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states. To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14-15 minutes--still faster than a fridge though. Also, the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs, ""no messy ice"". I thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it--note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using. Also, you still need to add water and the freezer packs don't really last that long. If you want to chill more than 1 bottle, I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent. Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can/bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water. Also, if you are chilling allot of beverages, there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts--they should put a drain spout at the bottom--I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink.

	I received this grinder because I had purchased a defective Melitta Grind  and  Brew coffee maker through Amazon.  The coffee maker had electrical problems and I sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed.  To make a very long story short---Melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker.  They stopped making them.  Amazon had my money and I waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker.  Amazon would not help me and after many, many phone calls Melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the Brew and Grind.  Grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months. WARNING--DON'T BUY MELITTA PRODUCTS AND RETURNS FOR DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO AMAZON.

	I, too, am SO disappointed with this product. When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we'll have to return this oven as well, and we've pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all

1671,"	Doesn't Do The Job
	The product is labeled as a seed grinder, so you would expect it to be able to grind seeds, but it failed miserably. I tried grinding flax seeds (about the size of sesame seeds) but about half of the flax seeds made it through the grinder intact. I even tried running the ""ground"" seeds through a second and third time but still wound up with a large portion of whole or almost intact seeds. That was with the grinder on the fine setting. It seems to be a combination of poor design and cheap parts. The ""grinding"" wheels are made of plastic which is not the best material for friction and the design allows a lot of the seeds to drop off the wheel into the chute without having actually been ""ground"" by the wheels. If you're wanting to grind a very small amount of seeds, try a manual grinder. If you're wanting to grind a medium to large amount of seeds, spend more money and get a proper flour mill

	I'm normally a fan of OXO products and own many of their gadgets. These measuring cups are the first problem product I've had from OXO...both the 2 cup and 4 cup sizes cracked on the bottom of the cup, right at the plastic injection point (that little circle with the tiny bump in the center of it), and they both now leak at the crack. These cracks developed very soon after I bought them, and I only ever washed them in on the top rack of the dishwasher. Because of the design of the cups, it's kinda annoying to wash them by hand - and they're not great for measuring dry ingredients for the same reason. So mine have gone into the garbage can, replaced by the KitchenAid cups of similar appearance (although without the handy interior measuring marks). My advice, keep your receipt if you buy these. Or skip them and get the KitchenAid, which have a non-slip rubber ring on the bottom, another nice feature. And they won't crack in the dishwasher

But the pasta was delicious.  I guess it just takes a bit of practice.  In future I will leave the dough longer in the fridge to ""rest"" before rolling it, and have a mini-production line ready to catch and flour the cut noodles.

The machine works great, I have no problems with it.  It is cheap, it may fall apart, but for this price who really cares?

It is not a good design for car use.  On the plus side I like the no-handle design and it has a small base which should fit most cupholders.  On the down side you need 2 hands to twist the lid open or closed.  Also the 'dribble-proof' design means that the mug has a very deep lip, and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing

1704,"	Pretty Blender Shaped Paper Weight
	This is our fourth new blender in the last three years.  My wife and I prepare one large smoothie everyday that has no ice, but lots of frozen berries, fresh fruit, etc. Nothing else goes in the blender. This blender looked nice and was so heavy it implied quality. It even worked great for a few months. Then one day the gear that delivers power from the base to the jar stripped right off. Now it is out of warranty. This is not simple to replace since the plastic/rubber piece separated from the steel shaft. We paid close to $100 for this thing so spending a couple of hours bringing it to someone who will charge $25-$50 to repair it seems like throwing good money after bad.  

This blender,like many others that I will not waste anymore time reviewing, is described as heavy duty, industrial or commercial grade.  None-I repeat-none of the ones sold at your retail store are comparable to the better commercial models. Save yourself time and money and buy the real commercial models that will last you a lifetime.  You can easily find quite a few brands and reviews on the internet. The ones used in restaurants, bars and other food service businesses are constructed to a higher standard and have replaceable parts that are readily available over the internet. Be prepared to pay $200-$500.

For someone who only occasionally will use a blender to make margaritas  this may be a very useful blender.

	I have never written an online review for a product before, but I am so annoyed by this dumb sifter that I just had to. I am not a ""speed"" baker of any sort, but I have four kids and do like to make birthday cakes, muffins, cookies, etc. My old sifter was so old it was getting flecks of rust into the flour, so I started looking for a new one. I chose this one after reading all the online reviews, and even though I saw that a few people found it slow, I was not prepared for how slow it really is! I just sifted 3+ cups of confectioner's sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes. As another reviewer said, in order to make it go faster I shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired. (I have never ever been tired out from BAKING before, fer' pete's sake!!!) I'm not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually USED a sifter. I'm stuck with the thing now, I suppose, so I'll learn to just go slower. But it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter - which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side. The one thing I really like is the caps for both ends - an innovation I'm surprised nobody else has come up with. But that doesn't redeem the product for me. In fact, if I can put my hands on another one of those old-fashioned ones (at a thrift store, maybe) I'll snap it up and put this new one in the Goodwill bin.

	This blender is very weak. It has a small blade that cannot pull down anything of substance and I had to stir even soft fruit in liquid or it would never get cut up -- just the bottom part of the mix spins around. I used this blender four times since August 2006 (when I bought it) to make 'smoothies', always with poor results. As the other reviewer said, the fruit stays lumpy. The little blades aren't strong enough. Yesterday I wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup. Of course they are thick and starchy, but after the usual 'stirring' to get them to move through the blender, the speed buttons started to vibrate and I could smell the unit getting hot. I wasn't overworking it -- mainly pulsing and then running it for about 30 seconds. All of a sudden, it wouldn't work any more. It just burned out. If you actually cook and expect a blender to blend things, don't buy this blender. I'm going to see if Amazon will take it back. (Note: after I wrote this, I was told by Amazon that I had to get in touch with the manufacturer, which I could do because it was within 90 days of purchase. However, the company wants me to mail in the plug and $5 for 'shipping' to get a replacement, which obviously I don't want. Why would I want to pay $5 more for a product that didn't work the first time? Why would I want the product again at all?

Maybe I can make it into an interesting planter and sell it at a craft fair . . .

1747,"	Pretty with some flaws
	I bought this teapot from Amazon in 2005 and used it numerous times.  The material is great, heat retention is good, it looks very nice, and I had no problems cleaning it (I use a babybottle brush).  

The tea infuser is not very effective though.  The holes are a bit on the large side, so any broken bits from whole tea leaves can still pass through.  And the infuser is too small for my taste to allow proper steeping of all the tea leaves, especially when I'm not planning to fill the pot to the brim (it doesn't extend deep enough).  So I don't use it at all (I put the leaves directly into the pot and use a strainer as I pour).

However, my biggest gripe is that the spout does tend to dribble after you pour.  So you have drops of tea trickling from the spout to the bottom in between pours, ending up with a wet spot on your table/counter.  I have to make sure I either wipe the spout in between pours, or set it on a dishtowel/paper napkin (unless I'm planning to pour tea to multiple cups in one session).  I found that pretty annoying.

So in conclusion, for the price I paid for this teapot's supposedly wonderful features, I don't think it was a good buy.

	I bought this box about 4 months ago and stopped using it about 2 months ago. It turned out to be more work than just a regular box. At least you can wash out a regular box and start over clean. Good luck with completely cleaning all the poo crumbs from the sliding track and cheap gears. It gets to be a disgusting affair, more than with a regular box. 

As other reviews said the rake only goes over the top half of the litter so there's tons of sticky cement left at the bottom which you have to manually scrape out. It was often unable to push the clumps into the bin. So it would just very noisily push until it got stuck, back up, and then start over again like 10 times in a row. When it does get clumps into the bin, it also pushes tons of litter through the crack between the bin and the box and then you're left with a huge pile of litter underneath the box. To clean it, you have to take it apart. The top part houses a computer so you can't soak it which means there's poo always stuck in the crevices. Ever see Office Space? At the end of two months I was ready to bring this thing out in a field and bash it with a sledgehammer. 

Now we're looking for another box. Currently, we are just using the plastic box from the littermaid without the rake, etc. This is my worst investment to date.

1756,"	Auto-ShutOff is incompatible with sewing and quilting
	The Professional label on this product is a big misnomer.

Ask frequent sewers and quilters what they hated the most about the last iron they replaced and they will almost invariably refer to leaking and the auto-shutoff feature if present.  Typically, they press seams as a batch and go back to sewing... only to return to a iron that has shut off and requires a reheating cycle. 

The auto-shutoff on this model makes it poorly suited for the sewing room where the 'professional' label should apply.

This (and other) Rowenta iron produces good steam and can burst steam to a certain extent.  However, usually between 6 months and 1.5 yrs, Rowentas begin to drip.  The valve design just doesn't hold up to water hardness that long. Failure number two.

For garment sewers and quilters, a professional system with a separate water boiler (tank) works far better:
* won't shut off on you
* since the iron doesn't make the steam (the boiler does), the sole doesn't have the 'hot spot' where household irons drip the water to make steam, which tends to scorch fabrics
* true professional models have a thicker sole which will maintain a more even temperature (still without the hot spot)

I teach sewing classes (garment, home dec, totes, etc.) and have completely walked away from household iron designs like this one.  You will not see this type of iron in a commercial workshop.  Noone there would have the time to wait for the iron to get hot again every time you've been away from it.

This iron is a better than average housesold model, designed for 'ironing' your laundry and not for pressing in a sewing room.

For general ironing duty (like laundry), check out the T-Fal 1759 Ultraglide Diffusion Iron for about half the price.  My t-fal irons (i've had 2) have outlasted my Rowenta iron, with just as good a performance and with the advantage of the ultraglide sole, a ceramic-like sole coating that does not scratch, even  over metal zippers (the stainless steal sole on the rowenta WILL scratch over metal zipper)

Rating this (and similar) Rowenta as a conventional household iron:
Performance 5
Durability  3 (before it begins dripping)

As a sewing room iron: 2

Overall Rating: 2 (because they label the product as professional, where it fails to the task)

P.S.:  for any household iron, be sure to empty the water tank after use to prolong the life of your iron.  Leaving water in the tank leads to premature wear of valves and seals

	I have purchased this item twice. The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty. The grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire. There is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it. The same is true of all brands.. Models sold as ""wireless"" are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill.  Somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire. That said, before it becomes useless, it works really well. Maybe the idea is to buy these by the case?

One solution I've tried that works pretty well, is to keep your receipt, and when the probe fails, take it back where you bought it for a replacement.

1806,"	Hardly Commercial Quality
	I am writing this to warn all of you cooks and bakers at home, that like me, prefer real commercial equipment in your kitchen.  Anything less is just a toy.  I had purchased the Waring Pro 1500 convection oven thinking this would be a quality convection oven to replace a Farberware convection oven that I have had for over 10 years and just plain wore out.  I ordered the Waring Pro 1500 from a catalog/online store other than Amazon, I don't know if it is legal to say, but it does have the word Chef's in it.  I was so excited to get it!  I opened the box, set it up, and was so disappointed.  It was made so poorly I was just sick.  The stainless steel top was not smoothed out, the oven door was installed so crooked it scraped the metal off of the side of the controls, and it had been dropped or something before packing because the feet were up inside of the thing, and the top was bent down.  The shipping packaging was fine, there was no broken packing and the box was fine.  OK, so I sent that one back, got a replacement thanks to the wonderful customer service at the online store, and opened the second one, same thing!!  I was so devastated, that I decided to give it a shot anyhow.  While cooking with it, the door had such a bad seal that it just steamed out the front, sides and bottom.  I was amazed that there could be such shoddy workmanship out there on what was being advertised as commercial quality.  OK, so oven number two went back, and I tried one more, what the heck three strikes you are out right?  Right!!  Finally oven number three came and it was put together so much better, seal looked good, top and feet looked good, so I decided to give it a whirl.  Once again, huge disappointment.  The convection fan goes on and off with the burner coils.  Thus not giving the cooking cycle a true convection.  I called Waring customer service and it was confirmed by engineering that they designed the fan to come on and off with the coils.  Bad design!  It took longer to bake cookies in there than it would my regular oven, and then they were hard and dry.  I rotisseried a chicken and it took over 1 and a half hours and when I cut it, the skin was soggy, not crisp, and it wasn't cooked all the way through after 90 minutes!  The thing popped (sounded like it was going to blow up) every time it heated up because they riveted the rack holders in there so tight, also making it nearly impossible to go from racks to using baking trays.  OK, that was it!!  After extensive internet research, I finally found a convection oven that is truly a commercial oven made for residential use, and exchanged it with the wonderful catalog/online store mentioned before and got the Cadco Commercial (and I do mean Commercial) half size convection oven Model number OV-350 and have used it many times since it's arrival and absolutely love it!!  I know it is twice the price, but as usual, you get what you pay for.  There is a smaller size version of the Cadco/Broilking oven that is quarter size, for people that do not need to bake huge quantities like me, that is the same price as the Waring Pro.  Please people, if you are at all a person that demands quality in your kitchen, do not waste your time on the Waring Pro, just skip right to the real commercial stuff and save yourself some major stress!!  Thanks again to the wonderful customer service at the aforementioned catalong/online company for NOT making me be stuck with the worthless Waring PRO 1500!!  Go for the Cadco!

1809,"	only good for very light work
	The FS150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you don't push this unit too hard or use it too frequently. Ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out. The two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor/gear train. First the slider is simply a  cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly. We found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards. Food grade Teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil.
The big problem with this unit is the motor/gear train that drives the slicing wheel. The drive gear is plastic and will not tolerate any kind of continuous load and will strip out fairly easily if pushed too hard. We smoked the motor and stripped the gears just slicing up a couple of small roasts and we were not working the unit that hard. 
It does a decent job for the person that just wants to slice up a small bunch of deli foods for a party or do a weeks worth of cheese for the kids lunches but honestly a good knife will do just as well and not set you back ten minutes for cleaning every time you use it.
If you are looking for a slicer to do more serious work you will have to spend the money and get something in the $400+ range. What this slicer is good for the deli counter can do for you for free when you buy your bologna.

1810,"	Very Difficult to clean; a truly horrible purchase
	I was actually satisfied with this slicer until I needed to clean it.  When you remove the blade, there is a plastic ring or seal that clings to a metal rim with brittle, plastic ""fingers"".  An intelligent engineer would have seated this ring in a channel rather than have it mounted by flimsy, brittle fingers to a thin semi-circle of metal.

Mine broke on the 4th cleaning; now the blade is extremly difficult to align, and it wobbles if you leave the part off.  Waring's website does not offer this part for sale, and customer service has not yet returned my call.

Updated March 24, 2006:  Customer service told me to clean this slicer by removing the three mounting screws rather than using the center screw.  This is more difficult, and does not permit you to clean accumulated goop that gets behind the seal.

They did send me a new ring or seal, but I had to eventually remove the whole blade when the smell of the goop became too strong.  All of the fingers had broken off the seal, so I had to use duct tape to reapply it.  And the blade really wobbles now.

This was very poor from a quality standpoint, and came off in my hand the first and only time used.

The way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a ""Good Grip,"" which is ironic since it's called the ""OXO Good Grips"" oven mitt.  It's hard to explain, but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt, you cannot easily grab things, especially if what you're trying to grab is small (like a pan lid) or narrow (like the handles on a roaster pan).  It's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven. I decided not to give it one star ONLY because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures.

	This stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream - built with quality materials like real metal (not silvery plastic), and sporting a sophisticated, drop-dead gorgeous retro appeal.  It looks equally as impressive in the hippest New York loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of Williams-Sonoma. 

However, as is the case when function follows form, this is a horrible blender.  Don't get me wrong - I'm more than willing to forgive a modicum of piss-poor functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant.  But quite frankly, this blender is beyond bad.

Most unfortunate is the blender's propensity to splash everywhere - even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand.  It seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing; it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor.  I suspect that the unit's quasi-industrial motor may be a contributing factor; it only supports two speeds: off, and jet-cyclonic.  While I admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right, the consequences of omitting ramp-up speeds are overbearing, consistently messy, predictably inconvenient, and potentially dangerous (as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing).  The irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward; and the blender's poorly-sealed lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion.  In fact, this blender splashes so profusely that it's nearly unusable.

It's too bad, because superficially, this blender really is quite the objet d'art.  But when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance, it has a long way to go - even in comparison to a $29 Oster.  

If I had to summarize this blender as accurately, succinctly, and fairly as possible, I'd distill it down to one word - ""regrettable.""

	Do not waste your time in purchasing this product.  At first, I thought this would be a great kitchen gadget for making small cones for my kids or when I just want a little treat, but I was wrong.  The manufacture didn't think that as soon as the waffles are done, you have to be quick and roll the waffles into cones for it too cool.  Well, instead of making one, you have to roll three in enough time before it cools.  I tried numerous times to roll each one quickly as possible, but by the second one the third waffle is cooled and has not had the chance to be rolled up into a cone.  It really is not smart for the manufacture to sell this product, unless it comes with three cone makers to wrap the waffle in.  And, to state that you need three people to make it or it will not work.  Do not bother purchasing this product, unless you are an expert cone maker.  I did, however, went ahead and purchased the regular sized cone maker.  It is hard to perfect the perfect cone without having a hole at the bottom, but at least I have time to wrap up one cone at a time without having it cool on me to quickly.  Also, the petite cone waffle maker is rediculously too small to try to wrap.  It really is a waste of energy.  You could put batter in only one of the cone indentions, and do it one by one if its what you are looking for.  That could work.  All in all, personally it wasn't worth my time and money spent on the thing

	I researched a lot before buying this slow cooker. I have a Nesco roaster that I love and use often. I needed a large slow cooker. I started researching. Started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot. I wanted a good one. The Cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and I thought well even it cooks faster that is fine. I will just watch it until I get used to it and go from there. Every dish I have watched..they all cooked in LESS than half the allotted time. Today I made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within ONE HOUR. Way too hot. I called Cuisinart several times and they said I may have a defective unit. Well I doubt it. I just think it runs hot. I really was dismayed because I love the size and the design of this cooker. Really was not up to par with Cuisinart products that I know and love. 

Let me also say that I am a good cook. I feel that I know my way around any appliance. I was not happy that I was not going to be able to leave this cooker all day but I was ok to give it a try.

1839,"	FAULTY FAULTY LIDS...THREE OF THEM
	After using my 3 new Circulon pots and lids for only 2 or 3 months, all the Circulon lids have broken plastic handles, including the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan. 
First noticed the problem when I got gouged by the broken plastic, I saw that all three Circulon lids showed big chunks of plastic off the underside of the plastic handles.  I am very careful and do not own a dishwasher. 
Next, I saw that two of the faulty handles now had big chuncks off BOTH ends of the plastic handles. All the breakage occured where the plastic 'cool' handle attaches to the metal part of the handle. Just today, when I removed the hot lid from my Toss and Turn pan, the black plastic totally came loose from the metal part of the handle! Only fast dancing saved me from this big hot lid falling on my feet.  But at last I saw the FLAW. Instead of these lids having a complete metal handle that is covered with the plastic for cool handling, the metal part only goes up an inch to meet the plastic. The black plastic only overlaps the metal part for A SCANT HALF INCH OR SO, causing the more sturdy metal part to undermine the plastic, and eventually causing the chipped plastic to separate from the metal with use. The lids are subjected to steam and heat on a daily basis, so no wonder the plastic broke off, the plastic has no backing. It is just carelessly and poorly attached to less than a half inch of the metal that is attached to the lid. This poorly conceived construction is why the handle broke away entirely after the plastic was chipped, A full metal handle covered with plastic would have been nice for the money spent and prevented the accident where the handle completely separated from the chipped plastic. There is no metal supporting that plastic folks. 
My enthusiasm for the Circulon was originally quite high, but now that I have lidless pots after less than 90 days, I'm pretty unhappy! This chipping happened to 3 out of 3 lids! AND the Toss and Turn lid is almost as expensive as the Toss and Turn pan! Now, after less than 90 days I must send in the Toss and Turn lid and my 2 smaller lids with chipped handles that go with the sauce pans. Because the Toss and Turn handle separated and broke away, this is not merely a cosmetic matter. Even before the lid handle broke entirely, the broken handles were uncomfortable to use with those sharp broken plastic edges digging into my fingers. Sending these lids back will leave me ill equiped in the kitchen after all the money spent to be well equiped. Further, I doubt their replacements will be any better, and they will probably need replacement every 90 days! Much as I love the Circulon pans, these lids make them a bad purchase. I would not buy this product again. Hopefully this review will help you make a good decision about Circulon pans and their bad lids

The lids are exposed to steam and heat every day, so it is no wonder that the plastic broke off, the plastic has no base. It is simply careless and poorly fastened to less than half an inch of metal attached to the lid.

Starting with the first piece of toast all is well (hence two stars instead of one).  However, after the toaster is warmed up, the timing/heat regulation becomes totally useless.  You have to toast, toast again, toast again.  Fancy digital count-down-timer doesn't help much at that point!  In researching toasters, did I mention I should have repaired my old toaster when it broke, I read a review where it was suggested that 'toasters have been around a hundred years, it can't be that hard!'

Starting with the first piece of toast, everything is good (hence two stars instead of one). However, after the toaster is heated, the timing / heat regulation is completely useless. You have to toast, toast, toast. No digital countdown timer will help!

To change speeds you turn a dial (as opposed to the buttons on most others), which makes for rough transitions. Moreover, the dial feels very flimsy and I doubt this machine will last.

Will go back to either an Oster or Waring, both of which served me well, each for over 10 years.

First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the  and quot;keep warm and quot; function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not.

	My husband bought this machine because it was supposed to be fast and convenient, and with different schedules, easier to brew one cup at a time. It worked fine at first, but now after just 3 weeks it leaks hot water all over the counter. This has happened to both my husband and me so it's not bad technique on our parts. We follow directions exactly, but we keep having to stop it, open the lid, check the pods, reclose the lid and try again. This takes all the convenience out of it especially when you have to clean coffe puddles off your counter. This just isn't acceptable, but it's mostly plastic so probably to be expected. We have used other pods besides the Senseo pods (which don't produce good coffee) but that shouldn't be an issue as they're all the same size. Anyway, we're trashing it and have ordered the Bunn professional which will hopefully do a much better job. I'll let you know in a future review. My advice on this one is either don't buy it or if you do, based on other positive reviews, keep the box and the receipt so you can return it when it starts malfunctioning

	I was excited to upgrade to this coffee grinder after years of using a cheap Krups model, and I have to say that I am very disappointed with the way this machine grinds coffee. It takes way too long to grind, whether pulsing or grinding continuously. And then the grounds are very uneven. Although the manufacturer says it is grinding slowly to keep the flavor in, every coffee expert I've consulted with says the longer coffee grinds, the more it heats up and the more flavor is lost. Even after long grinding, there are large pieces of bean still visible. I was also excited about the machine's detachable bowl, which does make for easy cleaning. But only of the bowl. The rest of the machine is a pain to clean and no matter how carefully you remove the top, your counter is covered in grounds. I bought a second bowl so that I could grind spices in the same machine, and I think the coffee grinder works better on spices and seeds (such as flax) than it does on coffee. But you still have to clean the entire thing before reusing it, or your spices have a strong coffee flavor from the grounds that are stuck to the protective case. (That plastic case does make grinding quieter, however.) All in all I'm quite disappointed with this purchase. I should have gone farther upscale and gotten a more serious burn grinder, or stuck with my cheap Krups with the slanted bowl base which made even grounds quickly.

1892,"	Quality of This Product Does Not Match Cuisinart's Reputation
	Cuisinart is one manufacturer that has capitalized on its brand name and produced this inferior product. My criticisms of this machine: 
1.  Its heavy and relatively large. It is awkward to place in and remove from a cabinet, and so it remains on the counter top where it takes up precious real estate with its large footprint. 
2.  It's slow.  With its weight, you would think the grinder would have a powerful motor that would quickly grind coffee.  It does not.  It takes a very long time to grind the coffee.
3.  The grind is uneven and actually clumps.  The grind is fine at the bottom and course and clumpy at the top.  The finely ground coffee sticks to the bottom of the bowl below the blade. I must use a finger to remove the ground  coffee or pound the bowel against the palm of my other hand. Pulsing makes no difference.  Grinding a full bowl improves the performance somewhat. Yet, grinding beans for up to minute still does not produce a grind fine enough for even a cone filter.  Espresso is out of the question.  
4.  I invariably spill ground coffee on the counter top no matter how carefully I remove the lid.  
Although the grinder looks cool with its stainless steel finish and it has a larger bowl than most blade grinders, those two alone do not even come close to overcoming its other deficiencies. Surely there must be better blade coffee grinders on the market

One way to make this reasonably useful is to seal it with a waterproof, non-toxic silicone kettle so that it does not move. Then you could scrub it right there in the sink and never pull it out for cleaning. Yehhh..."

	I honestly liked the blender a lot.  I received it as a gift and it matched the rest of my kitchen's KitchenAid appliances-- range, refrigerator, dishwasher, pretty much everything other than the toaster oven.  At the time, there could be no better blender.  It looked great.  It promised professional performance.  It had KitchenAid's brand and durability behind it.  

I use my blender for making tomato sauce and the occasional fruit smoothie.  There is some amount of ice crushing required, but that shouldn't be an issue.  I certainly was not a weekly let alone a daily user.  So, 3 years after I got the blender, I went to turn it on and it is completely dead-- no light on the on button.  Changed outlets and still nothing.  It's done.  What an incredible dissappointment.

But, it seems to me that the KitchenAid brand has really taken an awful turn since it was acquired by Whirlpool(?).  First, my dishwasher broke (3 repair jobs) then my stand mixer's seals are loose.  I called customer service about trying to buy a replacement thermometer for my range and after endless re-routing, I got no where.  The fridge has minor issues (loose rails, pieces not refitting) and is probably the best of the lot.

I did some research.  Apparently, KitchenAid is just licensing its name out on various products.  So, realistically, there is no such thing as KitchenAid quality anymore since they don't make much of anything.  Everything is just a re-branded product.  Whirlpool is going to milk the brand premium until its reputation catches up to it.

From a once KitchenAid loyalist, avoid this product-- yes it's beautiful but it's not going to last.  Avoid all KitchenAid products because they really are not what they once were

The box the unit arrived in was pretty beat up and did not look like it had been professionally taped.  It definitely looked like it had been returned by another customer, and lucky me, I got sloppy seconds.

I read the instructions and assembled it carefully, but the performance is just awful.  Even after letting it heat up for two minutes and then holding the trigger for 30 seconds, as the instructions indicate, it lets out a pathetic gasp of steam.  Additionally, it sprays out great gobs of water all over the clothes, and I don't mean a few spots of water like you get with any  steamer

1948,"	I'm so disappointed
	For fifteen years I've talked about getting a good stand mixer and my sweet husband went out and bought me this one. He bought it on sale at Cosco last Spring, then stored it until we moved back to the States from Europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in Nov.  I've used it a few times but the paddle and whisk don't reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will NOT tighten any further.  I can't get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position... to scape or to add ingredients. I like to make crepes, which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating. It's impossible with this machine. I get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl, unmixed... and the batter is full of lumps.  If I want to scape the bowl, (which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk doesn't reach all the way to the sides of the bowl) I have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time, and even then, with the paddle or whisk attached, it's not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back. You can't turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely. You have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand. This takes a fair amount of force to maneuver. It's impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter. The speeds are not variable enough. It seems to be either ploddingly slow or so fast that any liquid or flour flies out. 
It's a monumental disappointment and I'm frustrated because it's been so long since he bought it, I can't imagine they would allow it to be returned. So, I still mix everything by hand or use my stick mixer and feel crumby about the big white doorstop taking up counter space

	You have the bottom of the pan clad in stainless steel...the advantage of that? You can dishwasher stainless. But you can't dishwasher nonstick! You just have the disadvantage of slower heating than you would with straight aluminum underneath.

There's no indication that they will resurface your pan either...the warranty just covers defects, not use.

They are deep (which is good) but very thin and not thick as it appears in the product photos. So your meats will be less brown.

After rubbing it with a litlle oil before cooking I set out to make my first set of turkey burgers. Now the way I make my burgers is by adding some chopped onions, garlic, and green chillies to the ground meat. That is where the pan gave problems. The meat cooked ok but the small pieces of chopped onions, garlic, and chillies that fell out of the patties got burnt very fast and stuck to the pan making it difficult to clean. I spent about 20 mins cleaning each time.

For cooking meat that is seasoned only this pan may be ok. For me it is sitting in the closet after two tries. I did not return it because the shipping costs would have made returning it too expensive in itself.

Update (12/18/2004) I bought a Hamilton Beach 31603 Electric grill for around $20 which is tremendous. It is non-stick, dish-washer compatible and cooks great.

Eggs stuck.  Ok, must be my fault--try low heat.  I fried bacon on low heat.  Bacon stuck.  Fried eggs on low heat.  Eggs stuck.  Pan would not come clean with hand washing and mild soap (as the instructions advise).  I promptly returned the pan and got a non-stick.  My life is much better.  Do NOT be fooled by the pan's good looks.  Think its just me?  My wife's sister bought the same pan.  Her report: everything sticks.  My sister has the pan.  She hates it!  Guess what?  Everything sticks.  How can a product be so popular and perform so aweful?  You are hereby on notice.

	i have a lot of experience with steamers over the years - mine as well as others used in stores. stupid me, then, for not realizing that you get what you pay for. my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years, but it served me well. it is a machine of substance, solid parts, very stable. trust me - you don't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh, and i'm returning it immediately. the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep - not deep enough to keep the pole stable. the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended aren't firm - any heavy jacket will make them slide. the housing itself is amazingly lightweight; i thought that was a good thing, but now i know why the jiffy steamer's housing seems like it weighs a ton - you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored. handling a steamer is a serious matter. don't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive, poorly designed, lightweight steamer like the conair. spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years: jiffy. you won't regret it. and even though mine died after nine years, i have no regrets, and now i'll do the right thing and get another

1985,"	Not good design
	The design features for the on/off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things.  Otherwise, the on/off switch is not good at all.  The button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position.  You actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going.  The blade was sharp for the one and only time I used it.  I took it back right after Thanksgiving

	I was given Mr. Bento as a gift last summer. I was so excited! I bring a lunch to work every day, and I thought Mr. Bento would be the perfect solution to packing a well-organized, balanced, and easy-to-carry lunch. You can imagine my dismay when the Mr. Bento containers leaked day after day. Anything remotely soft came out from the containers, which do not seal in a tupperware sort of way. Cute? Yes. Impress your co-workers? Yes. But practical? No.

1987,"	Truly Mediocre blender; Truly disappointing smoothie maker
	I have owned this blender for two years now and will have to replace it due to one of the plastic mixer pieces snapping off, causing it to continually leak. Unfortunately it appears that I have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion.

Overall, there were definitely questions of durability over the years as small pieces broke off one by one, but it did tend to blend things. 

As a blender alone: It was not the most effective blender I have ever seen but neither was it the worst. It was truly mediocre through and through. 

As a smoothie maker: the mechanism used for the pour spout didn't allow any chunks to pass through, and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks. So as a smoothie maker it was not a good choice.
On the good side, the stainless does look nice... although it was a little tall

1988,"	Terrible waste of money
	This is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing

	I bought this set of knives 2 years ago.  I have not experienced the rust or pock marks that other reviewers have, and I have been pleased with the way my knives have stayed sharp even with a LOT of use.  The purpose for my buying this set was because of the locking feature.  I have little children at home and wanted to make the knives inaccessable to them.  Unfortunately the locking mechanism is a little too hard to open for me.  Mine gets stuck on lock and then I can't get it open without pulling on it with great force.  And when you are pulling on something full of sharp knives, that is a little uncomfortable to say the least.  I have worried more than once that the force I have had to use to open it would cause the knives to all fly out when it came free.  They never have, but it is unnerving.  I tried to contact Cuisinart about it, to no avail.  No complaints on the knives, and I love that there are extra slots in the block for expanding the set, which I have.  But don't buy the product strictly for the locking feature, it is not worth it
