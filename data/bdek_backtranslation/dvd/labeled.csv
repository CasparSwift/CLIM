0,"	Skip Color, Go Directly To The Black-And-White
 	I'm not sure why Sony, which now owns I Dream of Jeannie, decided to colorize the first season of this series.  Whatever the reason, you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on Amazon.com that the original black-and-white version of the first season is worth a lot more.  The reason for that is simple--I Dream of Jeannie was originally broadcast in black-and-white.  And for a television fan like myself, that's the ONLY way to watch the first season.

The episodes themselves are just as I remember seeing them.  Since I wasn't around in 1965, I'm pretty sure I've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here.  But to me, they're still pretty good.  The theme music, in my opinion, is every bit as good as the second theme, introduced when Jeannie went to color in 1966.  

The one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that Sony stripped off the old Screen Gems animation from the end of every episode.  That logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s, and it is consistenly rated, along with Viacom's old blue V of Doom, as the scariest logo in the history of television.  The new Sony outro doesn't pack the same punch.

Still, if you liked Jeannie way back when, you'll love it now, especially since you can watch it anytime you like, without commercial interruption

 	R.J. The Raccoon (Bruce Willis) was just looking for something to eat as he stumbles into his bear friend's (Nick Nolte) cave and accidently destroys his food, he has an entire week to find almost every scrap of food for him or else he dies. He finds a family of animals (Gary Shandling, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes, Steve Carrell, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Avril Lavigne) and uses them for his scheme to go over the large hedge near their territory to the suburbs where they steal food from the humans. Later on, the home-owner Gladys (Allison Janey) hires professional exterminator Dwayne (Thomas Hayden Church) to kill them but can RJ save his own life or his new friends's?

Extremely entertaining and fantastic CGI animated comedy from the makers of ""Shrek 1  and  2"", ""Antz"" and ""Madagscar"" Dreamworks provides great realistic CGI and laughs for everybody. There's also heart in this movie and shows the meaning of what it is like to have friends and be one's true self instead of being selfish! Steve Carrell's character Hammy the Squirrel steals the show here as the best character in the movie, it's a wonderful and hilarious movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.

This DVD has some good extras like two sneek previews to ""Shrek 3"" and ""Bee-Movie"", audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurette, VerneTech commercial, games, meet the cast featurette and gallery.

Highly recommended! the best Dreamworks animated movie since ""Shrek 1  and  2""

6,"	The First Woman in the Workplace Film
 	9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling.  It takes a look at the workplace from a woman's view.

We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is ""banging the boss"".

But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.

Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.  

The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.

The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory.

The subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.  And this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors.   You will laugh until it hurts.

DVD EXTRAS:
Commentary by producer Bruce Gilbert and stars Lily, Jane and Dolly

9 to 5 @ 25 - a 25 minute featurette with interviews with Gilbert, writer director Colin Higgins and stars Lily. Jane, Dolly and Dabney Coleman.

Deleted Scenes - 10 mostly expanded scenes or alternate takes.  The problem is without some kind of commentary we do not know why the scene was cut.

7,"	Great reference
 	I wanted to do a grad school paper on something I was interested in researching and I picked Hip-Hop. After working for an underground Hip-Hop magazine, I'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that I was too young to understand (being born in '81).  I visited the University of Hip-Hop in Chicago, interviewed underground artists, and went to breaking shows in the Illinois area.  Although I thought I was very familiar with Hip-Hop, after working with this magazine, I realized I knew NOTHING.

So when I was given the chance to do my research paper, I knew that I would be able to learn even more than I already knew from working for the magazine.  I watched the three parts of ""Beef"" first and saw an ad for this movie in the Extras section.  Honestly, the first thing that caught my eye was how gorgeous Mr. Wiggles was...but then after fully watching the preview, I realized this was the PERFECT movie for me to find out more about breaking.  

This movie documented the founding members, discussed the four elements of Hip-Hop, gave a lot of background information on Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash, talked about the different techniques in breaking, the label ""breakdancing,"" the media's dilution of breaking, the first movies that breaking was showcased in, new breaking groups...just a bunch of ""firsts.""  It was a great reference for my paper, I enjoyed watching it, and I could watch it over and over again.  I have a lot of respect for the founders because without them, headz wouldn't have this beautiful culture to express ourselves physically, mentally, and verbally

 	Honestly, I wasn't certain about this film, in fact, at first I actually believed it was related to ""Chocolate.""   I was terribly wrong yet most pleasantly surprised.  Upon first viewing, I did not laugh as much as the second time.  Yes, I tend to watch a film twice for I know we miss much the first time with our opinions and own theories.  I can be more relaxed and open minded the second time.  Second viewing was a belly full of laughter.

This is the best lesbian comedy I have ever seen.  The acting was wonderful and the film was fast paced.  Now that I decided that this film is exceptional, it was time to put it to the test on others (mostly women 20's - 80's years, some men.)  Each person I shared this film with, either loaning it or viewing it together, all responded similarly: ""This is a hysterically funny film.""  

What is even more amazing is the brief allotted time the director accomplished in completing the filming process - about twenty-two days. Congratulations, sometimes a tight budget can produce a true work of art.  Many short films I have seen on the ""Spiritual Cinema Circle"" also have numerous low budget wonderful productions.  Hoorah for the film art genius.

I applaud the entire talented cast and crew, especially actress, Christine Cox, her performance was exceptionally wonderful.  I would like to see her in more comedies...she's a natural.  I fell ""in love with her"" and I am straight gal, as are all of the actresses except for Frances.

A must see funny film.  I always wondered why the comedy male gay films always had that edge of humor when the lesbian films appeared more serious.  We need more films that are as pleasurable and diversified as ""Better Than Chocolate"".  Thanks bunches.

 	I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....  

The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful.

OK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick ""The Deep"" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.  

Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.

 	My 2 year old loves watching the DVD as well as listening to the CD in the car.  I have to admit that I have memorized all of the songs on the CD and the dances on the DVD too...they are very catchy and I find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around!  The lyrics are really cute and the beats are great.  Simple music but very creative.  I signed up for updates on Laurie Berkner's website so I can find out when/if she ever comes to town so my daughter (and I, of course) can go see her.  She is a great alternative to Barney and all of the other commercial characters, who I don't care much for.  I have bought this DVD/CD combo for all of my friends who have kids

 	This is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves.  The storyline is great, but this should have been the last DVD.  Things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over $20.  That's bogus.  DVDs can fit way more episodes on a single disc, and it's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately.  The Cowboy Bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start, then dropped down to 4.  Now it's just getting worse.  At this point I'm starting to regret buying the Stand Alone Complex series instead of renting it.  I am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out, though.  Throughout the series I think disc 4 was my favorite

 	JULIE JOHNSON is a quiet little film that deals with the frustrations facing a New Jersey housewife and mother who married and birthed before she graduated high school and finds herself in a rigid relationship, longing for knowledge to change things.  She considers herself stupid, sneaks Science magazines to read when her overbearing husband isn't around, and finally gathers the courage (while staring at the stars one night) to change her plight.  She takes a computer course, passes her GED and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life.  Along the way she discovers other secrets about herself, buried in the facade of a life she has led.  She changes, relates to the world in a different way, and refuses to settle for returning to 'the old life' when her husband returns promising her change.  Her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels, but in the end this friendship cannot last, as her girlfriend doesn't have the same goals.

The story is simple, but in the hands of the writers Wendy Hammond and Bob Gosse and with Gosse's fine direction, the entire cast gives us an ensemble of disparate characters in whom we can all believe.  Lili Taylor plays the lead with extraordinary skill and as her girlfriend Courtney Love gives a bravura performance.  The remainder of the cast (Spalding Gray, Noah Emmerich, Gideon Jacobs, Mischa Barton, et al) is likewise strong.  But it is Taylor's film and she offers one of her most poignant performances of her career.  A thoughtful, sensitive, engrossing film.  Grady Harp, September 0

32,"	KK Can Dance
 	I quite enjoyed watching this film, which is why I give it four stars, even though I think there are some things about it that are seriously problematic. So, why did I like it? Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Kevin Kline (in that order) and also a passably funny script -- at least one that is well structured for a feel-good viewing experience.

Joan Cusack is wonderful here. Her blow-up at her wayward fiance after he stands her up  is fantastic, and the scene where she stumbles from a bar out into the street, screaming ""Is this the Twilight Zone?"" at which point she collapses on the hood of Matt Dillon's car (in her wedding dress no less) -- well, that scene is adorable, especially considering that it ends with some truly touching readings of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet -- a play that itself explores competing definitions of masculinity. Yes, here is the heart of the film (so I cannot comprehend another viewer's criticism that the bride is given nothing in this film; she's obviously going to marry the movie star, and get to eat cheetos into the bargain). Matt Dillon is, as ever, the essence of cuteness, and a much more desirable husband than Kevin -- um, I mean Howard.

Kevin Kline does a decent job of mimicking Howard, a repressed gay man. But it still feels like mimicking, rather than acting. Here is also where the problems begin. I guess wearing a bow-tie means you are gay. And, similarly, the Barbra Streisand gag is beaten to death (and beyond). How many times can the viewers tolerate being told that all gay men like Barbra??!! Come on! Also, Kline's attempt to appear gay simply by giving us a limp hand gesture . . . Not only is it not enough; it's really kind of humiliating.

Nonetheless, the final scene does give ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" a run for its money, and I can't deny it: I did really have fun watching this movie. It's basically a sound little production, well structured, reasonably well written, and Kevin Kline can dance

 	If you are bored with Kurosawa's faithful decpition of historical Samurai (and who would be?), if you think the Samurai genre has been overused and outdated...then get ready for the hip-hop remix version of the age old genre: SAMURAI CHAMPLOO.  Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the man who brought us Cowboy Bebop and 2 shorts in Animatrix, with character design by Kazuto Nakazawa, Kill Bill vol. 1 fame, we are treated to a world that would have made the Wu-Tang Clan feel right at home.  The action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other. One follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play.  The music is all modern hip-hop, no moody asian flare here.

The story is about the adventures of these two warriors as they escort a pessant girl across Japan in search of a samurai who's only distinquishing characteristic is that ""he smells like sunflowers.""  Lack of money, food, and patience is a recipe for disaster and wacky hi-jinks in this adventure-comedy.  Rated 16+ (the equivilent of R in the US) for bloody violence and language.

36,"	WINNER  FOR  VISUAL  EFFECTS . . . EVEN  TODAY !
 	""The Good Earth"" must be considered a ""milestone movie."" As yet, there is no DVD  but one packed with out-takes about the making of this film would be especially welcome. There was no Oscar given for outstanding visual effects until 1939; otherwise, ""The Good Earth"" would have 'taken home' that award! 

The lovely Luise Ranier did  win ""Best Actress"" award. The 1937 movie was based on Pearl Buck's novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. Interest in ""The Good Earth"" was revived in Fall 2004 when it was selected for ""Oprah's Book Club"".   Perhaps women's rights advocates should also give it a boost?

The story is about China in the 1900s.  A simple farmer, Wang Lung, is 'given' (by his father) the slave O-Lan, for his bride.  I do not remember much from childhood about this film, but I definitely do not recall Paul Muni having such a mouthful of teeth! (special effecrs?!) Luise Ranier  had won an Oscar the previous year for her role in the ""Ziegfield Follies"" -- what a contrast!  Here she is the completely docile, loyal wife; as someone wrote, she was bound to her husband in ""eternal servitude.""  And her devotion was betrayed.  Partly through the machinations of ""Uncle"".  At every time of crisis in the story along comes (GROAN!) the crafty, manipulatve uncle (Walter Connolly) who whines  and  wheedles - - inserting humor (?) into the script and at the same time destroying family amity. 

From the Internet Movie Database are the prophetic words of former slave O-Lan:  ""When I go back in that house, it will be with my son in my arms. I'll have a red coat on him... and red flower trousers... and a hat with a gilded Buddha and tiger-faced shoes, and I'll go into the kitchen where I spent my days as a slave and into the great hall where the old mistress sits with her pipe, and I'll show myself and my son to all of them.""  (Smiles, contented)
Wang Lung:  ""Well... Now, I... I haven't heard you speak so many words since you came to this house."" 

Isn't the photography impressive for having been shot nearly seventy years ago? I found the quality of framed camera shots surprising  and  the production of many scenes quite amazing.  READ  Susan Wong's  wonderfully perceptive review on amazon.com.

Today's movie-goers don't seem to care about ""true life"" documentation in films,  but animation couldn't convince as the 1930s true-life locusts do! That tired word ""awesome"" truly fits this vintage film:  the choking drought  and  famine, the beautiful  'condensed' story of harvesting when they must survive the fury of a storm,  and the terrifying  scenes of revolutionary uprisings.

 	This is, as most critics agreed, the best of the trilogy.  Abrams' crisp direction keeps this film moving at breakneck speed from start to finish, including a few twists along the way.  I was thoroughly entertained by this outstanding action film.

The only thing I DIDN'T like.... the short pause in the middle of the film, probably for a change between the dual layers.  VERY annoying!

 	There is not enough footage on the feud with Macho Man Randy Savage. I prefer to see entire matches and more in depth behind the scenes regarding the whole story. What did the Macho Man think about it? Unfortunately we can never get to hear from Ms Elizabeth. Would these be included in a future Macho Man DVD set? I was always wondering if that was even legal to use a snake to bite another guy, especially in front of a huge live audience including kids. I was totally shocked when I first saw that on TV back in the 80's. Yes, that's hardcore. Deadly scary hardcore! That should not happen in the first place. The story involving Steamboat is well covered. It is a good example of how dangerous certain things can be. It is easy to think of something to do but actually doing it is another thing. There should be a line which should not be crossed. How can a real heavyweight guitar be used by Honky Tonk to hit Jake over the head? Human error? Hm... Nowadays Tripe H is using a hammer to hit others on the head. I guess a guitar is not a big deal by today's standard. Enough is enough. We don't need accidents! They may be an unevitable part of sports, but not part of ""entertainment.""

 	I first saw this in the theatre because I like Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson.  I had never really seen Topher Grace outside of 'That 70's Show' which I never kept up with on a regular basis.  I fell in love the movie first time I saw it and bought it soon after it came out on DVD.  

Mr. Grace plays a 26 year-old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend.  He's become such a machine in a competivie world that he's loses his way in life.  I was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too.

One of mentor's has told me repeatedly that the mid-twenties can be one of the roughest times in life.  So many things are going at once on so many levels.  To me, this movie captured that.  Paul Weitz did a great job writing this.  The cast was exquisite

47,"	My FAVORITE Movie of 2006
 	I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD since I first saw it back in July. I still can't understand why the critics just didn't get this one. This has to be one of the best second films ever made in a Trilogy. The addition of Davy Jones was brilliant. It made the film much darker and more dramatic. Johnny Deep was superb as usual. I still can't believe that the film made $400 million dollars domestically and over $1 billion dollars worldwide. It's surreal. But everything about this movie was so on point that it's not too surprising that it exceeded the first film. I enjoyed this one more than the original. I thought the story was more interesting on this occasion. Although, you had to wonder what was going to happen in the absence of Geoffrey Rush's character. He and Depp played so well off each other in the first film it was hard to imagine the second film going on without him. It was a huge void to fill. But enter Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and all is well. I guess that's one reason why ""Dead Man's Chest"" woks the way it does. Billy Nighy gives an A-list performance. And when you add in Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, it's money in the bank. The only trilogy in my book that ranks higher is the original ""Star Wars."" Yes, I prefer ""Pirates"" over TLOTR. Although, perhaps my comments are premature since ""At World End"" hasn't even been released yet. Should that be a dud, then of course the whole thing falls apart. But here's hoping that the third time is a charmer. If you own the first ""Pirates"" on DVD then you have to get this. Don't miss out.

51,"	Werner Heisenberg, King of Noir.
 	Leave it to the Coen Brothers to make Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle the crux of a film noir, and darned if they don't make a good case for it in ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" (Typically, they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who can't even remember Heisenberg's name.) Chain-smoking nebbish barber Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) makes the only decisive (and dishonest) action of his life, and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several, mostly not-so-innocent, bystanders. In ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" the phrase ""decisive action"" is an oxymoron; everything Crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance. Everything that happens--from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face--changes everything forever, and always for the worse. Set in 1949 in Santa Rosa, Calif. (a tip of the hat to Hitchcock and ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" perhaps?) ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" looks perfect. Like every other Coen film, it's a marvel of production design, and the genius photographer Roger Deakins nails to a tree the dusty black-and-white look of such classic noirs as ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Out of the Past."" Thematically, however, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant, much better acted remake of Edgar G. Ulmer's ""Detour,"" in which the characters drift in a low-rent Sartrean hell, totally the victims of fate. But whereas ""Detour"" is more than the sum of its parts, ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is less. The Coen Brothers may believe in chance, but on the screen they leave nothing to chance, so that everything in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" is TOO perfect. In the end the film has the same overstudied, clinical quality that afflicts every Coen film except ""Fargo."" (It must be admitted, though, that only one Coen film--""The Hudsucker Proxy""--is ruined by that quality.) The acting is as superb as in any Coen film. Thornton--in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together--burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense, hangdog gravity. There are also glittering supporting performances by Frances McDormand as Thornton's philandering wife Doris; James Gandolfini as her paramour and boss; Jon Polito as a shady businessman; Michael Badalucco as Thornton's motormouth brother-in-law; Scarlett Johansson as the teenager Thornton chastely fancies; and especially Tony Shalhoub, nearly stealing the picture as Freddy Riedenschneider, defense attorney extraordinaire.

 	I was not privy to the world of Christopher Guest until a friend of mine told me that if I liked `Drop Dead Gorgeous' then I would flip over any of Guest's films.  The video store only had one in, and that was `Best in Show' and I'm SOOOOO glad they had it.  This film has to be one of the funniest films I've ever seen, a complete riot from beginning to end.  As a true `mockumentary' every scene is shot pretty much adlib and you can sense the intended on the spot dialog as everyone is being interviewed and or followed around to `document' the Mayflower Dog Show.  The film follows a group of dog owners as they get ready to show their little bundles of joy.  There's Jennifer Coolidge and Patrick Crenshaw play Leslie and Sherri Ann Ward Cabot (total spoof on the whole Anna Nicole Smith scandal), owners of a prize winning poodle who's won `Best in Show' 2 years straight, and with the help of lesbian handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch) hopefully she'll win for a third.  Then there's Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest himself), a southern bloodhound owner who dreams of being a ventriloquist.  And there's power comic couple Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara who play the Flecks, owners of a terrier, who struggle with Mrs. Flecks long line of previous lovers.  There are lovers Stefan  and  Scott (Michael McKean  and  John Michael Higgins) who spoil their Shih Tzu's and each other.  But finally we have the star couple of the show, the neurotic Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey  and  Michael Hitchcock), owners of Beatrice, and beautiful yet disturbed and `negative' Weimaraner who's been traumatized by the sight of this young couple having sex.  Their antics, arguments and strange affection to their dog is some of the funniest scenes in the whole film, and their chemistry is pure brilliance.

56,"	Oh, the things this kid does...
 	Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another ""sick"" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).
It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: ""Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it."" That's the moral of the story, really.

57,"	Inspiring and well-made
 	Highly enjoyable tale of the life of Marty Maher, the Irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become West Point's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years. Despite personal tragedies, and through two World Wars, Maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished Army officers' academy, including future legends like Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Tyrone Power is excellent and compelling as he portrays Maher from young idealist to elderly sage, Irish accent intact all the way. The scenery and West Point pageantry is fun to watch (although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio -- but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the Military Academy). Interestingly, there's not really all that much football in this film -- there's a little, but it's mainly the story of Maher and his family, and the young men he came to love like his own sons. With the flame-haired Maureen O'Hara as Maher's Irish wife Mary, giving a  radiant performance. Sentimental in that '50s way, of course, but the legendary director John Ford (working with a cast made up of many of his favorites) always puts a bite behind the sweetness

 	This is a work of genius. It is creative, original, funny and well done. That being said, it is probably not for everyone. 

This wonderful takes as its starting point a couple of very minor character from Shakespeare's HAMLET. These are the stars of the show. In Hamlet, they are merely a couple of friends of the prince called in to help deal with Hamlet's melancholia. They appear briefly and are gone. The last mention of them comes when the royal court hears a message that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. They are merely there to drive forward the story of the prince.

In this work, the hapless two are called in for the same purpose but the story centers around them. The spend the entire film trying to figure out what is happening to themselves and to those around them. As they discuss existential questions, the tragedy of Hamlet plays out around them. It is quite funny but some background helps.

It helps a great deal if you are comfortable with Elizabethan speech. Whole pieces are lifted from Shakespeare and the added dialog is of the same style.

It helps if you are familiar with Hamlet. That makes understanding the context easier.

It is great fun if you have some knowledge of physics. Rosencrantz spends the whole film on the verge of making monumental discoveries in basic physics but is thwarted at each turn.

It's is fun.

61,"	cutting edge comedy
 	Nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent.  Every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even William Shatner would envy, and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical.  As anybody who has seen this show knows, the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into double-entendre and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for British comedy.  (Although, as ""children"" of the Three Stooges, Americans are, I think, accustomed to somewhat heavier-handed comedy.)

For those who don't know this series, it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids (I wouldn't let mine watch with me until they are at least 20, by which time they will probably find this material boring).  If you are assembling a comedy collection, however, this series fills a unique niche.

My only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate.  It doesn't even come in a box, but rather in a little ""accordion-folder"" package which is neither aesthetic nor practical (can't stack) nor particularly protective.  It is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them (I chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble, but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape; works fine)

But when you put together a comedy collection, this show fills a unique niche. My only complaint is that the packaging is a little second-rate. It does not even come in a box, but in a small ""Accordion Folder"" package, which is neither aesthetic nor practical (not stackable) nor particularly protective. It is also difficult to remove the discs from the central fasteners without damaging them (I chipped a first thing out of the box, although I was expecting difficulties, but attached with carefully trimmed packaging tape; works fine)"

 	I am a huge anime fan, and this is by far the best.  Lemme just say, God I can't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is.  It inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy.  The whole series is actually based on a true story in Japan.  A few hundred years ago, the entire population of wolves in Japan became extinct.  There are people there, even today that report wolf sightings occasionally :)

If you're a fan of wolves, or looking for something a little different, CHECK THIS DVD OUT!

The musics great, the drawing is perfect -- not just a random bunch of stills like most animes, but actual movement!  You get 4 episodes per DVD, each is a little over 20 minutes long.  This DVD includes:

19. A dream of an oasis -- this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep.  Kiba finds a place where he is truly happy, and wonders if he has finally found paradise.

20. CONSCIOUSLY -- this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series.  It has gorgeous music, and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever, just brilliant.

21. Battle's Red Glare -- Orcom's men are fighting against an enemy, and the wolves are caught in the middle.  We see a lot of Blue in this episode (she's so cute as a puppy :) and Cher.

22. Pieces of a shooting star -- The group decides to cross a sea of ice, but it turns out not to be such a good idea :(  Toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff.

I can't say enough about this series -- unless you've seen the whole thing, you can't judge it.  It's made by the same people as ""Cowboy Beebop"" and this DVD is preparing us for the typical BONES conclusion ;)  The next DVD is way sad and very depressing; no matter how tough you are, you will be crying by the end

63,"	Not just a rehash of The High School Reunion Collection
 	Okay...when I heard about The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection I was pretty sure that it was probably just a rehash of The High School Reunion Collection which was released several years ago.  Both sets were released by Universal.  Fear not, I am here to tell you about the differences.  The first thing that is painfully obvious about this set is the choice of movies.  Like it's closest cousin The High School Reunion Collection, The Brat Pack Movie and Music Collection includes the exact same movies-""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Sixteen Candles"" and Weird Science.""  The cover art on the DVD's is the same, no new bonus material with each film that I detected.

It has been mentioned time and time again that the choice of movies is a bit off.  No one even really pegged this acting group ""The Brat Pack,"" until around 1985.  Molly Ringwald was one of the best known Brat Pack members and ""Sixteen Candles"" helped to start the whole Brat pack phenom but no one ever considered ""Weird Science"" a Brat Pack movie. Trust me, I remember the 80's.  It always seemed like it would make more sense to include ""St Elmo's Fire"" or ""Pretty in Pink"" in with this set.  This is painfully clear with the bonus music disc included.

The music CD includes the following songs-""True"" by Spandau Ballet, ""Tenderness"" by General Public, ""If You Leave"" by OMD, ""Weird Science,"" by Oingo Boingo, ""Oh Yeah"" by Yello (which was in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", Pretty in Pink by the Psychedelic Furs, ""Don't You Forget About Me,"" by Simple Minds and ""I Go Crazy"" by Flesh For Lulu.

Why include music from ""Pretty In Pink"" and not include the movie?  On to the packaging.  The packaging is very unique and makes the set worth owning.  I own over 100 TV on DVD and box  sets and nothing is like this.  The DVD's are held in what is literally a three ring binder and the DVD's are in sleeves instead of jewel cases. On the back page of the binder is a pop quiz.

For the most part it is very similar to The Highschool Reunion collection but it's nice to have the bonus CD and the cool packaging.  However, it would have been nice if Universal would have given fans who bought the previous set a little more inspiration to purchase this new collection. One must assume they must not own the rights to ""Pretty in Pink"" (it's listed as a Parmount DVD) because that is easily one of the best known Brat Pack movies and it seems insane that it is not included in a set with the term Brat Pack associated with it.

65,"	Greatest injustice since Sacco and Vanzetti
 	The question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act, but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders. The answer, presented by material in the film, is an unflinching no. There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three.

The film's strengths are that it doesn't preach, at least not in an overly wrought narrative, and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims. I can understand the pain and confusion of the victim's families. What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them. The victims' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film. At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone ""I hate them... I hate them and the mother's that bore them.""

Is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child? No, quite natural really. But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started. I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in... I'll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time.

On the issue of the prosecution. They had next to nothing. A very questionable confession from a terrified kid, Jessie, with a 72 IQ, hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof, a knife found behind Damien's house which doesn't match the wounds on the bodies, and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca, he must be a Satanist.

To look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film. Jessie, a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world. His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder. Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's. The second reason, and the most important, is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera, smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them.

All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other, more sinister and shocking, suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it, and terrifying to think they didn't

Some of the acting performances are a little over the top, and the musical selections, though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists, are weak in the lyrics department; however, as a whole, the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational.

Perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by Hollywood, and is having great success on both the stage and screen.

This compilation lets the viewer experience and/or revisit those money-making stage shows.

76,"	Good workout, lots of fun and sweat!
 	As you can tell from my other reviews, I own a lot of Kathy Smith DVD's. The reason is she has solid workouts that are fun and she has great cue-ing and instruction. She always cues from YOUR point of view, when she says left it's YOUR left, which makes it easy to mirror her on the screen. 

This step workout has 3 segments, designed for beginner, intermediate and advanced. The beginner should stop after segment 1 and go to the cooldown. The intermediate stepper should finish segments 1 and 2 and then proceed to the cooldown. The advanced stepper can do all 3 segments before cooling down. 

Each segment gives you two options: high impact (power moves) or low impact. Higher impact consists of modifying low impact moves to contain more jumps. One person in each segment does the low impact moves so you can follow her. 

Segment 1: 12 minutes long. Easy to follow basic stepping. Kathy and company use a springboard step but any step (or even no step for beginners) will work just fine. 
Segment 2: 13 minutes long. Slightly more intense than segment 1 and more add on sequences. After you've been stepping 6 minutes Kathy moves to squats and lunges which gives you a rest and lets your heartrate lower. This is my only complaint about this video, I wish she would have added this at the end of the entire video and continued cardio through the entire 2nd segement. However, this segment only lasts ~4 minutes so it's not that big of a deal. There is a heart rate check after this segment. 
Segment 3: 12 minutes. The step is switched to the other position for a bit more variety. A few squats and leg lifts in sequence finish out this segment. 

There is a 5 minute cooldown and a little bit of a stretch (probably won't be adequate for most people after this workout). 
She has a safety demonstration after the cooldown where she promotes the step she shows in the video, but should be viewed by first time steppers to make sure they do it properly.

77,"	Absolutely fantastic musical, deplorable DVD case
 	I'm giving this item five stars simply because the disc itself is grand - you receive one of the greatest MGM musicals ever conceived and it's bolstered by quite nice extras. That much you can be assured of.

I'm writing this particular review because of Warner Bros. insistance on using fragile, cheaply made cardboard sleeves rather than the standard plastic dvd cases. 

The problem with these Warner cases is that the pins holding the disc can break if even the slightest pressure is applied to the case, rendering it's capability the actually hold the disc useless. And unlike the plastic cases, the Warner ones cannot be replaced save for returning the disc to the original purchase place or attempting to contact the manufacturer (good luck with that, by the way). 

Another problem lies with the fact that it's made out of cardboard - when you remove the anti-theft stickers almost invariably the sticker will peel some of the artwork off the cover. This can occur even when you're carefully attempting to slowly peel the sticker off.

The reason I feel the need to mention this is I own dozens of Warner movies, and well over half of them are damaged in this manner and irreplaceable outside of purchasing a new one (not likely, Greedy Bros.)

To be fair, Warner has finally began producing plastic cases with some of their newest releases - the top-notch Film Noir and Gangster collections offer the films in splendid little plastic cases. But titles like ""Kiss Me Kate"", ""Rebel Without A Cause"", ""Broadway Melody of 1940"", and even ""Wizard of Oz"" are still only available in these sad cardboard cases.

 	I just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone's MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.  

Riveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, ""a tour through hell.""  This film makes you think.   The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another.

During the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn't depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films.

All of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN'T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict.

I felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn't close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time.

The film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see.

Overall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific.

 	I agree with some of the reviews where the quality is not as good as say Baby Einstein videos, however, I still recommend this video for children just learning to speak or with speech delay. My two year old son was not frightened by the woman in the black turtleneck although I agree that the facial expressions are pretty bland.  I love the tips on helping your child with speech and language at the end of the DVD. My son is already trying to make new sounds since watching for only a few days. The video has given us new ideas on helping our son progress with his speech and language development. Hope this review helps those that are on the fence about purchasing.

I wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries, personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting. Some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it.

85,"	""Keep movin, Tyler. Gotta keep movin.""
 	One of the most beautiful and sympathetic movies ever made about wolves, Alaska, and the Inuit, I could watch this movie over and over and not get tired of it. A mid-level analyst who just happens to be in the right place at the right time (he has his doubts early on)is chosen to go North to investigate the Arctic wolf and its impact on the caribou population. Along the way he encounters a host of intriguing characters, including a crazy-like-a-fox entrepreneurial bush pilot looking to make some sort of big score, a number of wacky bit players who I can easily imagine were not actors, but the real deal, and every bit as eccentric as they appeared; and an endearingly sage old Inuit of few words but many eloquent silences.

The investigator, Tyler, is not at all sure that he's up to the demands of the job, but forges ahead regardless, played with practical flair by Charles Martin Smith, a perfect choice for the lead here. I would be at a loss and panic-stricken if left alone on a frozen lake in Alaska, as his character Tyler is; Tyler takes it all in stride, trusting it will all be good in the morning, even though it is established early that for all the fact that he was chosen for this mission, he goes into it with a deep-seated terror of wolves.

After the assistance of the old Inuit man in getting centered on his path - and the abrupt disappearance of his benefactor, who has a way of coming and going that magicians would envy - Tyler finds himself deep in the bush country and immersed in the world of wolves before he realizes how completely they have taken him over. Knowledge and observance quickly negates his fear, and he is brought to a serenity of spirit and understanding of his place in the world that makes me wish I had the courage and stamina to go out and try it too.

A caveat: there is a culinary moment in this movie that might cause the squeamish some distress. Do what I did at the crucial moment; look at the ceiling, or recite to yourself, ""It's only chocolate, it's only chocolate."" You'll know when it gets close; they don't spring it on you; and it IS just chocolate.

Highly recommended for the whole family.(Oh one more caveat; if skinny-dipping adults offend you - briefly skinny-dipping, and not flagrantly overt - then maybe this isn't your movie.)

86,"	Look out, Mickey, they're coming for you!
 	About a young scientist (played by Charles Martin Smith) who goes to the Arctic to study wolves, their survival, and their effect on the caribou herds (he proves they are not killing the caribou, as it had been assumed). He is a fledgling in the wilds, but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves. He notices the wolves eating mice, and begins to do the same himself - a supreme irony in this Disney film. The first half is excellent, compelling and beautiful to watch; but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a man-as-encroacher bad guy message and a confusing man-as-wolf Indian mysticism presentation. It's wonderfully photographed, though, and the soundtrack is stunning

 	Who could ever forget the image of happy-go-lucky Manuel Fidello (Spencer Tracy) turning the handle on his little accordion box singing in that gentle, infectious Portuguese accent, ""Yo ho little fish don't cry don't cry"". If you're a fan of classic films you know this is a scene from Spencer Tracy's signature movie, `Captains Courageous' released in '37. 

Plot: Harvey (Freddie Bartholomew), an Ill-mannered rich kid falls overboard off a luxury vessel and finds himself adrift until a passing merchant fishing ship pulls him out of the sea. He is taken under the tutorage of his rescuer, a friendly Portuguese fisherman named Manuel. Harvey is initially hostile to the thought of having to obey orders and work for his room and board until the ship returns to dock, but eventually comes to understand the important lessons in life being imparted by Manuel. Before his adventure at sea is over he'll learn what it means to be a man.

This is without a doubt my favorite Spencer Tracy film and a story the entire family will enjoy. It's beautifully filmed with a tremendous cast which includes along with Spencer Tracy and Freddie Bartholomew the legendary Lionel Barrymore as Disko and John Carradine as Long Jack

 	When you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the `70's generation you're talking about Paddy Chayefsky's brilliantly written black comedy, `The Hospital' which was released in `70.

A contemporary, dysfunctional, urban hospital serves as the microcosm of America's failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century, but the mental and emotional illnesses as well. George C. Scott stars in the role of Dr. Herbert Bock, hospital administrator. Dr. Bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity. His wife has left him, he's estranged from his children and he's in the grips of a mid-life crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question. When a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff Dr. Bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad.

With great performances by George C. Scott and the lovely Brit Diana Rigg, `The Hospital' is a thought-provoking film that will elicit discussion and debate. Watch it with a friend

 	The story of a young award winner of a filmmaker's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get ""his"" first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by Christopher(Spinal Tap)Guest. It's a cynical and hysterical look at how Hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis.
 
Unlike many of favorable reviewers I'm not a fan of Christopher Guest's later works and that's not just because I'm envious of him being married to Jamie Leigh Curtis(lucky dog). I don't find Guffman or Best of Show more than mildly amusing at best. Save for Bob Balaban in Guffman(When Sparky comes back, I almost bust a gut). 

Sometimes artists do their best work up front. I like Woody Allen's first three pictures the best(What's Up Tiger Lily, Take the Money and Run, Bananas). I think this is the case here. Guest hit gold. Great script, terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast. A near genius(I'm gonna steal one of the other reviewer's word here because it's so perfect, kudos and thanks) ""turn"" by JT Walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history(alas, another ""great"" dying so soon before his time like Warren Oates and Robert Shaw). Fabulous work by Martin Short, Teri Hatcher, J,T, Walsh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Fran Drescher, Dan Schneider, Jason Gould, Wakter Olkewicz and seriously I could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines. There are tons of people in this sublime comedy. 

Its only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the Eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene(Bacon/McKean)that comes off as way too cloying. Other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of Hollywood. 

Someone said comparing this to The Player was like comparing Bagger Vance to Caddyshack. I'm not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be sub-par. Caddyshack is a classic and so The Big Picture. I am a big, big fan of Altman and The Big Picture is even par with The Player. If either were more biting I would give the nod to The Big Picture. Though, Richard E Grant's performance is almost as good as Walsh's.

Nick's(Kevin Bacon)flights of fancy are hysterical. This is an inspired and unfortunately one-of-a-kind comedy.

96,"	A Classic Haunted House/ Ghost Story
 	First of all, I have lost count of the ammount of times I have seen this movie but every time I watch it I get goose bumps. This is how affective the movie is.

George C. Scott (of ""Patton"" fame) plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy. Soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and Mr. Scott begins to investige the house's history. This is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film.

This movie is all about atmosphere. There are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays. This film does not need to gross the viewer out. The Changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters. You are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease. There is nothing ""in your face"" about the scares. 

This film is for fans of the 1960's film ""The Haunting"" or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story. Don't even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and I guarantee you'll watch it more than once. I have recommended it to many people and I never heard a negative comment. For the full effect, wait until night to watch it and then watch it alone. See how many times you glance over your shoulder.

97,"	A high water mark for journalism and film
 	One of the productions of which he is the most proud, Robert Redford's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN should be required viewing (and the Woodward/Bernstein book should be required reading) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist.  Redford was fascinated with the story of two young, untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the Watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the United States.  Redford's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary, so he followed as the story developed.  He got to know Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when they were still at ground level, still unsure as to where this would all lead, but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics.  

Redford has always been a political animal, with a reporter's instinct, and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the American political climate.  Earlier, he and director Michael Ritchie had made THE CANDIDATE, a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well-meaning of men or women (and a film well worth your time).    It took two years of hard work to get ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN off the ground.  It was turned down by several studios, with the excuse that people were tired of Watergate, but he was finally able to get Warner Bros. to say yes, provided Redford himself would star.  

Dustin Hoffman was enlisted to play Carl Bernstein, Redford's old friend Jason Robards won an Oscar as Washington Post Editor-In-Chief Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden was cast as Editor Harry Rosenfeld, Martin Balsam was Editor Howard Simons, Jane Alexander was Judy Hoback, bookkeeper to the Committee to Re-Elect the President (C.R.E.E.P.), Ned Beatty was Martin Dardis, who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence, Stephen Collins was Hugh Sloan, whose wife Debbie (played by Meredith Baxter) kept his conscience working on the right side, Robert Walden (who would go on the the fine television series LOU GRANT) was Dirty Trickster Donald Segretti, and Hal Holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story:  the mysterious Deep Throat, who helped Woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall.  Of course, we now know that Deep Throat was the FBI's Assistant Director W. Mark Felt, an old friend of Woodward's and a man torn between his loyalty to the FBI and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings-on.  

Redford asked Alan J. Pakula to direct and Gordon Willis to handle the cinematography, and they crafted a look that is part documentary, part thriller. (If you get a chance, also see Pakula and Willis' THE PARALLAX VIEW, starring Warren Beatty.  Another outstanding, scary political film.)  William Goldman, who won an Oscar for BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, wrote the tight, exciting screenplay for which he won again (this was actually the fourth time Redford and Goldman had worked together; Goldman also adapted Donald E. Westlake's THE HOT ROCK, a very funny caper film, and the poignant THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER, which was out for a short time on DVD in Pan and Scan, but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful Widescreen splendor.  Universal, where are you?)

The efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN a smashing success.  It succeeds as an exciting, suspenseful procedural, as a statement on the neccessity of a free press, as a character study, and as a great movie-movie.  

The double-disc DVD set is the one to buy:  the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp, clean 1:85 aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by Redford himself.  The second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film, on Woodward and Bernstein, and on Deep Throat.  There is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film, and an interview with Jason Robards on the Dinah Shore show.

A deserved landmark in film and in journalism, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a must-see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be, a must-own.  In our darkest hour, when all seems obfuscated and hopeless, it reminds us that light can be brought to bear.  People CAN make a difference

 	LIL ABNER is a delightful comedy-musical with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals.  This film version of the Broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on DVD in a beautiful print with it's comic book coloring.  It's also superbly cast.  The film's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play Lil Abner and Daisy Mae - Peter Palmer (who starred in the Broadway show) and Leslie Parrish - but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles (it's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as Abner anyway, although Daisy Mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era). It's a shame neither Palmer or Parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years. Both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals, as the Dogpatch crowd might say.  

It's true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable - notably ""Jublian P. Cornpone"", ""A Typical Day in Dogpatch"", and ""Put 'em Back The Way They Was"" which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young Valerie Harper (""Rhoda"") and Beth Howland (""Alice"") but most of the songs are good-humored  and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original Broadway show.  Jerry Lewis has a funny walk-on cameo and the gorgeous Julie Newmar and Stella Stevens have amusing secondary roles. Most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here, including Donna Douglas as the busty hillbilly girl (a few years before becoming famous as one on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES) who wants ""to broaden our horizons"" and is informed by Mammy Yokum (superbly played by Billie Hayes) that she her horizons is broaden enough.  There's quite a bit of political satire in here as well (with politicans with such apt names as Mayor Dogmeat and Senator Jack S. Phigbound) and the Sadie Hawkins Day sequence (a Dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it's own with many high schools for years having an annual  ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"" in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered ""acceptable"") is a lot of fun.  But then so is the movie.  As a Yoakam says when they really mean it - ""I Has Spoken!""

100,"	Funny Carey, interesting adaptation
 	I saw this movie before I read the books. The books are much funnier, and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film. Still, I liked the film and especially Baby Sunny. I thought Jim Carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions (as always) brought the character to life. I think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film, the essence of the story was captured, and is entertaining. But I do recommend reading the Series before or after watching the film

 	""Haunted Castle"" and ""Alien Adventure"" are great, but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"" makes it better than the other two.  The film is an excellent way of showing how 3D started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in, other than the entire movie itself.  I do wish the mine ride was longer though (the one which ends with the big, round, stone ball slamming into the tunnel) and there was more shown of the T3 Experience.  Sure, the Jules Verne ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" ride certainly makes up for it, but the effects in the shorter example were awesome, like the bats.  Best of all, the film doesn't look all that dated CGI wise for a 1998 production.  Now I've definitely got to get the sequel ""Misadventures in 3D"" DVD.  Noticed something stupid in the credits for ""Encounter"".  Instead of saying ""Cassandra Peterson as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"", it redundantly reads, ""Elvira as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"".  Unlike the other 3D IMAX films, this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2D wise.  Of course, the best is 3D since that is the whole point of the story anyway.  I highly recommend this movie to all 3D collectors

102,"	Excellent Documentary in the Maysles Tradition
 	That this film is dedicated to the memory of David Maysles should tell you all you need to know about what's in store. Along with his brother Albert, David Maysles created some of the most groundbreaking and fascinating documentaries of the 60's and 70's (""Gimme Shelter,"" ""Salesman,"" ""Grey Gardens""), and Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky did a fabulous job here of carrying on the stylistic tradition. The story of the poor and semi-literate Ward brothers is touching and engrossing, despite the squalor in which they lived, and this early 90's legal case is a significant study in cultural assumptions and regional justice. Absorbing, and worth owning.

This 10th anniversary edition packs on a host of extras, but just an FYI: The ""Product Detail"" here on Amazon that suggests that this 'stars' Connie Chung is wildly inaccurate; she did a piece on the Ward brothers which we see them watching on a TV for a couple of minutes, and that's all.

 	Lady and the Trap has been an enduring Disney classic for 50 years now and it's amazing how well it holds up after all that time.  The hand painted animation is beautiful and the story and music are top notch.  This film is an example of Disney animation at its classic best.  

But calling Lady and the Tramp a great animated film is really selling it short.  It's a great MOVIE, period.  Lady's idyllic life is shattered and bad boy Tramp comes to her rescue.  While he begins his relationship with Lady in the dog house (sorry, couldn't resist), he slowly redeems himself in her eyes and love conquers all in the end.  If you've seen any romantic comedies from the last several years and compare it to this movie you'll realize that a story about two dogs is actually more romantic and more funny than virtually any similar film featuring humans.  Watch Lady and the Tramp and you'll know why this film is still so loved after 50 years.

 	I have been a casual fan of the radio version of ""Prairie Home Companion"" for decades, although I seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time, usually only if I am driving somewhere on a Saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast. I read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it, and while most critics kind of liked it, there were a few grumbles. However, I thought the film was excellent, and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans. I liked all the casting, too. Robert Altman is not a favorite director, but when he is good, he is very good, as in ""M*A*S*H* and ""Nashville."" When he is bad, he is terrible. But here, I thought he done good. Same with Garrison K. I trashed his recent novel in an Amazon review, but I liked him in this.

110,"	A bittersweet love affair in modern Italy
 	This is the best film I've seen in perhaps six months or more.  The direction by Turkish/Italian director Ferzan Ozpetek is consistently interesting, intriguing, beguiling and ultimately satisfying both emotionally and intellectually.  The film is beautifully cut, and the acting, particularly by the fascinating Giovanna Mezzogiorno who plays the young mother of two whose name is also Giovanna, is first rate.  

The story begins in a bakery during World War II when Davide Veroli (Massimo Girotti) is a baker's apprentice.  We see him among the great earthen ovens and the warm loaves as he makes what appears to be a sprint out of the cave-like establishment.  But he is pounced upon by the baker.  They wrestle, a knife is grabbed and apparently the baker falls and there is blood on Davide's hands as he runs out into the streets.

Cut to modern times as Giovanna and her working-class husband, Filippo (Filippo Nigro) are crossing a bridge in the city.  They meet an old man who seems lost and disoriented.  He can't remember his name and he has no identification.  Filippo takes pity on him and against his wife's wishes takes him home with them to their apartment.  We know because of the man's age that the mystery of who he is has something to do with the men in the bakery scene from World War II.

But his story is only tangential to the central story of the film which is about Giovanna's brief affair with the man next door, Lorenzo (Raoul Bova), whose apartment window faces hers.  This is a love story, a bitter-sweet one--which all great love stories should be in some sense, since life itself is bittersweet.  It is framed by, and contrasted with, another love story, that involving the older man from many years ago.

The tension in the film revolves around the resolution of the affair between the married Giovanna and the handsome man who will soon be leaving the city.  Will she abandon her marriage and her family for the excitement of a new man?  Because the police can find out nothing about the old man, and because Giovanna's heart softens toward him, and because he is an elegant man of refinement, especially in the pastry arts--Giovanna's dream is to be a pastry chef--the man is allowed to stay for a while and the two are drawn together into friendship, the old man and the young woman.  

That's enough of the plot--the development, the denouement, and the resolution of which are beautifully realized in both an artistic and an emotional sense.  Instead let me say that the feel of modern Italy with its racial tensions and its old world versus new world differences are nicely expressed as the past makes itself felt on the present.  The dialogue is wonderfully expressive and gives us the sense of authenticity and the kind of realistic effect seen only in the very best films.  This is the first film directed by Ozpetek that I have seen, but it won't be the last.

But see this for Giovanna Mezzogiorno whose beautiful and expressive eyes and natural demeanor will hold you to the screen

 	I bought this at (yep, you guessed it) the grocery store, which was a very clever marketing concept on Martha's part. There was only one DVD left. It contained Classic recipes for chicken, beef, fish, vegetarian and other main dishes. If you think you ALREADY know how to make classic, everyday dishes such as meatloaf, think again - because Martha's variations may put a whole new twist on your usual standards. Her use of fresh herbs truly does make a difference and the glaze on her meatloaf was one I hadn't tried before. My family loved it. 

    There is also a section with Bloopers (yes, Martha's mistakes or mishaps while filming a scene - slips, falls, etc). There are 12 different cupcake variations and an extra section on kitchen tips (I learned plenty of new things from this section). 
  
  I have to admit that I looked at the Bloopers section first, intrigued by the idea of actually seeing Martha make mistakes.. and I only wish there were more of those. They were funny, especially the one showing Martha pulling an X-rated carrot from her garden. You'll have to buy the DVD to see the rest. It is a very short section, however.  

  Then I watched the DVD from start to finish and marveled at the quality of the production, as well as HOW MUCH information was packed into this DVD. From start to finish, each recipe was demonstrated clearly. I intend to use this one with my youngest child because it is a perfect introduction to some classic recipes, from roast chicken to meatloaf. They may not be made the way you are used to making them but in one case that was an advantage...the meatloaf recipe was far better than my standard version and the glaze was delicious (do be aware of your oven's peculiarities, however, and cover the top to keep the glaze from burning; uncover just long enough to brown). It would be best, of course, to use an oven thermometer and know your oven's actual temperature since 350 in one oven may not be 350 in another - those dials may be inaccurate. 

  But don't make the mistake of thinking this is only for beginning cooks (although it'd be a perfect housewarming gift for the college graduate who is just setting up house). There are plenty of new recipes, especially a squash casserole which I am dying to try on my vegetarian friends, after having tested it on my family and getting rave reviews. In fact, one of the nicest sections of this DVD was the Vegetarian one. Each of those recipes looked delicious.

   Martha's mother is featured in some of the segments and that was a pleasant surprise. She and Martha chat as they cook and the whole atmosphere is nice and casual.  

   No matter what you may think of Martha Stewart, this DVD is a top-notch, quality production with tons of useful info.

114,"	Altman's overlooked 70s masterpiece
 	Often overlooked, Robert Altman's 'The Long Goodbye' is arguably one of THE films exemplifying the 1970s and, although far less dark, ranks alongside Antonioni's 'The Passenger'.

Propelling Marlowe into the opulent, 'promise' of the west coast 1970s USA, Altman allows the story to unfold around a classic murder, mystery story and the stunning cast help to create an atmosphere of parochial 'goings-on' that can subsequently be seen in the works of David Lynch, Tarrantino and, more recently, the 'Sopranos'.  The late, great Sterling Hayden gives an unforgetable, bullying, volatile King Lear-like performance as the ageing, impotent, alcoholic writer, and Mark Rydell's 'dangerous' violent character anticipates that which Martin Scorsese and Joe Pesci create latterly in Goodfellas/Casino. Moreover, there's an uncredited cameo appearance of a moustachioed Arnold (Schwarzenneger) as a 'heavy'. 

However its Elliiot's Gould's brilliant (Oscar deserving) performance as Philip Marlowe that helps to  seal this film's status into the canon of GREAT films. 
Gould creates a sharp, amiable, chain-smoking, wise-cracking 70s detective whose 'quirky-alone' livestyle allow him the freedom to give his own Chandleresque, talking-to-himself dialogue (...'it's alright by me...') whilst interacting with a diverse range of characters within the narrative. With respect to this, there's the continual variation of the haunting melody, 'The Long Goodbye' that is re-worked throughout the film thus floating the narrative structure within changing and moving events and themes yet anchoring it to the overall thread of the story itself.

Altman's direction is that of a genius at work: the back-drop of the oceanic tug and wash of the tide as seen through the windows of the seductive though manipulative Eilleen Wade's windows (Nina Van Pallandt), together with slightly surreal and erotic appartment  setting of Marlowe's flat make this film unforgetable. There's also the tension associated with the 'journeys' to Mexico: a theme used in more recent (great) films including 'Lone Star'; 'Traffic'; and, 'The Three burials of Melquiades  Estrada'. Who can deny the impact of the opening 'cat' scene and the final 'chapter' of the film  set within the avenue of trees; the 'oh-too-late' figure of Eileen Wade heading in the opposite direction to Marlowe who ironically celebrates his parochial sense of closure by playing the minature harmonica.

 If ever a film rated as a '6' for special merit and sheer enjoyment then this is one of the elite few deserving of such an award! I urge you to watch or re-watch this film and savour a work of pure genius. As a commentator and fan of such a seminal film, I can only hope that Robert Altman and-or Elliot Gould can provide a commentary-enhanced (Criterion edition )DVD

124,"	""ha ha ha, you didn't say the magic word, ha ha ha...""
 	I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards.  A few of the characters were switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession.

And after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing, the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in the novel and film, Malcolm was right. ""Life finds a way...""  

(In Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions, and ""random"" --unpredictable-- events result from the ""normal"" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce, ""survive,"" in a single-sex environment. And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.)

Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.

We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class. I've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be there for each tour?).

The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't notice this until I was a little older, but Lex (""I prefer to be called a hacker"") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor. If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now...

Anyway, the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in the mid-90s.  Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994 Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of her excellent music choice

125,"	A late 1960s social satire with De Palma and De Niro
 	""Greetings"" is an offbeat satire from a very young Brian De Palma starring an equally young Robert De Niro.  The vignettes focus on three friends.  First there is Jon Rubin (De Niro), an aspiring filmmaker who has the idea of creating ""peep art.""  This would consist of filming ""private moments,"" and then letting people view them through tiny windows, thereby re-creating the Peeping Tom experience (more of this in De Palma's much better 1970 film, ""Hi, Mom!"").  However, if you are expecting to see an amazing performance by one of the great actors of his generation in an early film, you are going to be disappointed.  De Niro comes off as overly mannered and a bit forced in his performance, especially in comparison to his two co-stars.  His best moment is off-screen as he talks a woman through going to bed for his peep art (she repeatedly forgets not to talk).  But he is a lot better two years later and had a decent career, at least until he started making credit card commercials.

First there is Lloyd Clay (Gerrit Graham), a conspiracy nut so obsessed with the JFK assassination that a half-naked woman sleeping in his bed is just another opportunity to show that the paths indicated by the bullet holes do not match up (unless JFK was shot while standing on his head).  Lloyd shares his deep, dark thoughts directly with the viewing audience as he argues vigorously to convince us he is right.  But sometimes he finds people in the real world to assault with his blow-ups from the Zapruder film that reduce the assassination to a Rorschach test.  Finally, we have Paul Gerald Shaw (Jonathan Warden), who would like to find the right girl.  His problem is that he has his induction physical and going to Vietnam will really hurt his love life.  Fortunately, Lloyd and Jon are fully of ideas as to how Paul can get the army to reject him, everything from pretending to be gay and coming on to the sergeant (Lloyd's idea) to volunteering to shoot not only the Vietcong but also any American troops of color (Jon's brainstorm).  

There is no real narrative thread here, which is hardly a criticism because ""Greetings"" is more of an ancestor of ""The Groove Tube,"" ""Saturday Night Live,"" and ""Second City TV"" in the history of contemporary sketch comedy with a heavy satirical bent.  The difference is that what De Palma and his friends come up with in ""Greetings"" is more experimental guerilla theater than really polished sketch comedy.  But there is something compelling about its enthusiasm, which makes us forgive the filmmaker and his actors when things go on a bit too long.  De Palma has admitted to being influenced by Godard and the French ""Nouvelle Vague"" cinema, which inspired going out on the street and trying to improvise scenes (only they did not have enough film to improvise, so they ended up rehearsing most of the film to save money).   But even in this early work, De Palma is clearly into doing everything you can do with a movie camera (inter-titles, split-screen, slow-motion, fast-motion, etc.).

""Greetings"" is a historical footnote in cinematic history inasmuch as it was the first film in the U.S. to be given an ""X"" rating (later changed to ""R,"" which is what it would qualify today because of some of the shots of nude women).  In terms of social history ""Greetings"" represents some of the counter-culture politics of the late 1960s.  It had been almost thirty years since I first saw ""Greetings"" and ""Hi, Mom!""  Back then they constituted part of my first real exposure to radical thought in terms of what was out there on the streets.  If you see just one of these films, interested in how De Palma was cutting his teeth as a director before he made his name with ""Carrie"" and ""Dressed to Kill,"" then ""Hi, Mom!"" is the choice (the ""Black in America/Be Black Baby"" bit is the must see segment of that satire).  But if you are interested in De Palma's career or counter-culture comedy from the late 1960s, then check them both out

 	Ella of Frell (Anne Hathaway) is an unusual child.  As a baby, a bumbling fairy godmother named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) gave her the gift of obedience.  Every time anyone gives her a direct command, she must obey.

Despite, or maybe because of, this ""gift,"" Ella grows to be a headstrong woman.  She goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres, giants, and elves.  Current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only.  But Ella campaigns for their equality.

She is also one of the few women in the realm who doesn't swoon at the site of Prince Char (Hugh Dancy).  When the two meet accidentally, Char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman.

Trouble is brewing at home, however.  Ella's stepsister Hattie (Lucy Punch) has figured out Ella's secret.  Now, Ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do.  So she leaves home and sets out to find Lucinda to give the gift back.

 	Once again the saga of Motoko Kusanagi refuses to fall into the popular mold - as manga, as a pair of feature films, and now a TV series, it combines the classic crowd pleasers of the science fiction of a not too distant time,  a topnotch group of secret agents, and a beautiful woman with a story line that isn't fraid to stop and contemplate the complicated world where the line between mechanical and human, program and soul, get crossed every day.

What you will see for most of these last few episodes is the dismantling of Section 9 when their efforts to get to the bottom of the Secretary General's plot result in danger to the nations politicians.  This invites retaliation and everyone goes undercover and, eventually, fall into the governments hands.  All the Laughing Man's efforts seem to come to naught and theire is every sign that this series is about to have a very nourish ending.

Well, all I'll tell you is that the ending is worth all the trauma of getting there.  These three episodes really focus on the characters of the Section 9 team in unexpected fashion.  And even the Tachikoma's make a reappearance.

This has been a contemplative series.  First the ethical questions raised by the Laughing Man and human cyberization, then the even more difficult issues of what life is or can be.  In these episodes Kusanagi reveals a personal philosophy which is both chilling and evocative of the samurai code.  She is a modern Tomoe Gozen, unendingly loyal to Arimaki and fiercely defiant in battle.  

This has been a series with considerable depth that echoes but never slavishly imitates, the work that has gone before.  A fine piece of work from both an artistic and an entertainment point of view

  this was a staple of late night t.v. and for some reason the sunday afternoon movie. you can tell in the stunts that it's not heston and some of the speachs are well corny, but the movie even with it's down beat story is fun and can be scary for younger kids(still i would be very careful about letting young ones see it as it has some nude scenes in it)

136,"	There is something tragic about being 50 (recommended)
 	SUNSET BOULEVARD is a drama that reveals the unsightly day-to-day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense. Joe Gillis (William Holden), a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers, holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. While walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool, he is shocked to discover it's occupied by old silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). 

Living with a devoted chauffeur, estranged from Hollywood and forgotten by fans, in Desmond's mind, she is still a star working on her next big roll in a script she has been scribbling for years. Knowing the script doesn't have a chance, as a writer, Joe looks at this as an opportunity to ""fine tune"" it to earn some extra cash. However, the working relationship is not all that tidy. It seems lonely Desmond is looking to sponsor a gigolo. His payment is a warm place to stay at night, a closet full of clothes, nice meals, private ""parties,"" and Desmond's ever-present company.

If it were possible for Desmond's self-admiration to be supplanted by anything, it would be the possessiveness for Joe's affection. Young Joe needs a break from such austere surroundings and eventually goes out to a party with real people and meets a girl engaged to an old friend. Through a series of secret rendezvous they begin to collaborate on a script with real potential and, naturally, develop feelings for one another. The girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on SUNSET BOULEVARD is a formidable challenge. 

With some of the most memorable quotes in Hollywod, this is a wonderfully produced ""noir-comic"" drama by Billy Wilder that well projects the intense emotions, not only of each character, but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent. Other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are ALL ABOUT EVE, AN IMITATION OF LIFE, and WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE. A gem on the DVD extras is the history of fashion legend Edith Head.

138,"	Great ocean shots in the Bahamas
 	I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....  

The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful.

OK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70's flick ""The Deep"" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let's face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.  

Overall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.

145,"	Hector Elizondo is great in remake of ""Eat Drink Man Woman""
 	Hector Elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill.  Aside from his superlative work as a Doctor on ""Chicago Hope"" he has been often cast as a sideman in films - the trusted aide, the sympathetic boss - but often in supporting roles.  In ""Tortilla Soup"" he takes the leading role in a Mexican-American remake of Ang Lee's ""Eat Drink Man Woman"".   

He plays Martin Naranjo, a Mexican Chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist.  The movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared, then eaten, that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen.  Martin is has lost much of his sense of taste, which he thinks is a cruel irony, but his Cuban partner reminds him that Beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing.  Martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago.  Elizabeth Pena is Leticia, the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple ""grace"" into mini-sermons.  Jacqueline Obradors is the saucy Carmen, who was encouraged to get her MBA by Martin, but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion - as her father did with his wondrous cooking.  Tamara Mello is the youngest Maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to ""find herself"".  Constance Marie is family friend Yolando, who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who Martin dotes on.  Raquel Welch is Yolando's mother, Hortensia, who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished Martin.   

The film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions.  At the beginning of the film all of the characters are single.  By the end they've all been paired off in one manner or another, some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others.  Raquel Welch is a bit of a distraction in the film.  At age 61 she has a show-stopping beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25.  In a film full of attractive performers she doesn't ""look her age"" enough to blend into the story.  She plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester. 

The movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and I would recommend it if only to watch Hector Elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen.

148,"	This film is a powerful concentration of life in a small area of Italy.
 	Although subtitled Grazia's island (Grazia is the lead role, magnificently realized by Valeria Golino), ""Respiro"" could have well been called ""Scenes from rural Sicilian life"", as the scenography, cinematography and tableaux-like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line. Respiro's locale is Lampedusa, a tiny island far off the west coast of Sicily. About the same latitude as Malta, this place is about as remote as it gets - Tunisia is closer than Palermo. It can be safe to say that Italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades; this is Italy of de Sica and Mascagni, not Fellini and Prada. The men go out to sea, the children play, women pack fish, old black-clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky.

Throughout this film you would probably ask yourself, ""Is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited?"" It's a fairly typical story, the type that a few great (and many, many average) Italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations - life in the sun drenched rural, ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds. How long since ""Cinema Paradiso?""

What I like most about the movie, besides the appealing scenery, was the interrelations of the characters, the humor, petty gossips, the impromptu emotional outbursts, the displays of maternal and filial affection. The two boys are tremendous: the older Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) is the more mature of the two. The younger Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings, often without sense. His rant against the busybody women is a treasure, as is his little-brother-as-big-brother protectiveness of his sister from the policeman-friend. The boy embodies an epic Italianate inflammability far beyond his years. While viewing this I thought the son's affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times. They do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village.

After seeing this film, I have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar, the differences are in the languages, but the feelings are same.  I enjoyed this film so much I might see it a couple of times.

149,"	Just 'Breathe' in the Joy of this Special Tale
 	RESPIRO is one of those Italian treasures of a film, this time written and directed by the insightful Emanuele Crialese, that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and  foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story.  RESPIRO mixes the gut-level Italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by Fellini.

Lampedusa is a Mediterranean island between Sicily and Tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of Italy to be a return to the native.  The population is all involved in fishing.  On this picturesque island lives Grazia (the beautiful and talented Valeria Golina) who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality.  She lives happily with her fisherman husband Pietro and her children: teenage Marinella (Veronica D'Agostini), Pasquale (Frncesco Casisa - a very fine little actor!) and Filippo (Filippo Pucillo).  The boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother's wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace.  

When Grazia's actions come under scrutiny by Pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother (Muzzi Loffredo) who occasionally gives Grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests Grazia needs psychiatric help in Milan, Grazia runs away to hide in a grotto, her whereabouts are known only to Pasquale.

The little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of Grazia, only to discover on St Bartolo's Day that Grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean.  How this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie: revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of RESPIRO.  Suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away!

This little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography - both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean - of any film you'll see.  The music by John Surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric.  The way director Crialese  captures the folklore-like behavior of the youngsters' games, and the married-to-the-sea philosophy of the villagers, is utterly magical.  This is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society.  RESPIRO is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to Eden.  In Italian with English subtitles.   Grady Harp, November 200

 	Now it is almost as if this movie was a warning about what our country would look like in 2004.  A relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into us and them.  

Bob Roberts, a son of a hippy couple rebels against that world view and uses music as a means of spreading conservative propaganda.  Marketing hate and intolerance in the flag, this movie frighteningly shows in fiction what is being done in reality today.  

I think Bob Roberts will be a movie that historians will study 200 years ago and see it relevant for discussion of the United States around the turn of the millenium.

A relevant look at how easily people can be manipulated in the political process and how easily we are divided into ourselves and them. Bob Roberts, the son of a hippie couple, rebelled against this worldview and used music as a means of spreading conservative propaganda.

 	If you are not familiar with research, this nice approach to a scientist's  work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies. Besides, this very interesting and moving film, with  high level and homogeneous performances, will show, the closest it can, the early facts about such a terrible disease. I strongly recommend it. I have seen it with my 16 year old son, but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age. A bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience.

 	I'll make this short and sweet.  I used to work in spin.  I did advance, which is creating media events for politicians.  In other words, for a time I was one of those people that manipulated public thought by the way in which we delivered information.

That which is represented in this piece is true.  The observations are astute.  The prognosis is grim.

 	Your milage may vary; but I found this movie white-knuckle intense and extremely provocative.  There is little danger of giving away the plot; it is not particularly complex.  Three stupid, arrogant American teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from Finland to the former USSR, which at the time was very much the USSR and a Very Bad Place for Americans.  They make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate.  So far so good, but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the Russians who mistake them for spies.  Some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving, that I'll keep a secret for ya.  I can promise you one thing:  If you are American, after seeing this, you'll salute the flag, think real hard before traveling overseas and I'll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border

161,"	Fred Astaire, Rita Hayworth, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer...And ""I'm Old Fashioned""
 	In some of Fred Astaire's movies there's only one excellent reason to watch, and that's to watch Fred Astaire. In You Were Never Lovelier there are three other excellent reasons. Rita Hayworth. Jerome Kern. Johnny Mercer. The four of them have concocted a romantic and funny South American fable that features some great dancing by both Astaire and Hayworth and some memorable songs by Kern and Mercer.

Eduardo Acuna (Adolphe Menjou), a wealthy Buenos Aires businessman, has four beautiful daughters, and in the Acuna family they must marry in age order. The eldest fulfills her responsibilities and the two youngest have beaus they're now anxious to share vows with. But the second eldest, Maria (Rita Hayworth) is in no hurry. She wants romance and charm and the men she meets are just panting boys. Then she sees Robert Davis (Fred Astaire), a very charming, down-on-his-luck dancer, singing Dearly Beloved at her elder sister's wedding. He tries to chat her up; she stares him down. Then the plot intervenes. Before long she knows what she wants. Robert knows what he wants. Eduardo Acuna knows what he doesn't want...a down-on-his-luck dancer in the family. From then on it's songs, dances, romance and misunderstandings, which moves into songs, dances and romance. The plot feels sluggish at times and there's way too much Xavier Cugat and his orchestra, but Astaire and Hayworth are at their peak, Kern has written some memorable melodies and few could top Mercer at lyric writing, none in Hollywood.

Hayworth not only was a gorgeous creature, she was a gifted dancer; many think she was the best Astaire worked with. Technically, she not only handled the steps Astaire created, she did so without a hint of effort. After you've watched the dances a couple of times, go back and watch again, but this time concentrate on her face and her hand and arm action. She gives every indication of being utterly relaxed and enjoying herself, even in the fast tap routines. She seems naturally to find the most graceful attitude for an extended arm, a turn of her head, a raised hand. She may not be quite as good as Astaire, but she's good enough.

Among the stand-out routines are:
--The Audition Dance. Robert shows up at Acuna's office and demands a chance to show his stuff as a dancer. From there Astaire takes off on a fast tap routine that takes him all over the floor, onto Acuna's desk, the sofa and chairs. He works into the dance a cane, a rug, the drapes and Acuna's head. 

--I'm Old Fashioned. This is probably the best romantic wooing dance Astaire did. It's all fluid motion and spontaneous recognition, danced on the elegant, polished outdoor landing of Acuna's mansion. Rita Hayworth is a vision, and matches him step for step. We move from Maria declaring with humor and assurance that Robert's the man for her, to Robert's protestation that he's just a guy from Omaha, Nebraska, to the dance that brings them closer and closer together until we know through the dance that a love match has just happened. The funny exit through the doors and back into the living-room, bumping into each other, each giving way, bumping again and then going in together arm in arm hits just the right note. The dance works so well in part because Kern and Mercer came up with a classic:
I'm old fashioned,
I love the moonlight,
I love the old fashioned things.
The sound of rain
Upon a window pane,
The starry song that April sings.
This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs, holding hands,
These my heart understands.
I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it.
That's how I want to be,
As long as you agree,
To stay old fashioned with me.

--The Shorty George. This fast tap routine starts out with Maria visiting Robert at a rehearsal. He sings The Shorty George and she takes a couple of lines. He looks surprised that she knows the song. He starts to dance and invites her to join him. Hayworth stays right with Astaire and looks like she's having the time of her life.

--You Were Never Lovelier. Robert declares his feelings for Maria, but more misunderstandings occur. Finally, everything is resolved. Robert shakes off some knight's armor he was wearing (there is sort of a reason) and appears below Maria's bedroom window in black tie. She rushes down...and off they go dancing while all the members of the Acuna family look on approvingly. And the Johnny Mercer lyrics and Jerome Kern music brings us to the happy end:
You were never lovelier, you were never so fair; 
Dreams were never lovelier,
Pardon me if I stare.
Down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;
I can only say they chose the proper place.
You were never lovelier, and to coin a new phrase, 
I was never luckier
In my palmiest days.
Make a note, and you can quote me, honor bright,
You were never lovelier than you are tonight

162,"	BY THE SEA BY THE BEAUTIFUL SEA
 	CITY BY THE SEA is a movie that is propelled by its rich performances, particularly those of Robert DeNiro and Frances McDormand. Both Oscar winners, they infuse their characters with such humanity and imperfection, they make this movie much better than it would have been in other hands. James Franco, although obviously  and quot;in and quot; to his performance, comes across attempting to repeat his Emmy award winning role as James Dean. The mannerisms, the false bravado, the hurt and pinched face, are trademarks of the late Dean, and Franco seems to enjoy using them again. William Forsythe approaches a caricature of his role, but it's still spinetingling enough to make your skin crawl. Anson Mount as the moralistic cop Dave Simond, gives a strong, understated performance, showing that all cops aren't bad. George Dzundza as DeNiro's partner is also good, as is Linda Emon, as his wife in a very touching and sad scene where DeNiro confronts her after Dzunda's death---apparently at the hands of DeNiro's son.
 The movie is to be commended for giving us characters with flaws, and in understanding the way some relationships never fully materialize or heal.
 The film has some marvelous cinematography of the old Asbury Park area, and has an ending that while not totally satisfying is real.

I understand that we all make choices, but how many do these young men have? It is a racist, exclusionary society that has condemned them to their fate; to die violently at the hands of their own brothers. Its sickening. Society is more of a menace to these young men, than they are responsible for being a menace to society.

Having said that, the movie itself is excellent. It's gritty and real to the 'nth' degree. Movies like this should be a huge wakeup call for the 'powers that be' in this country, but the reality is that the grave lessons it teaches will pass unnoticed

167,"	This Set Will Grab You
 	This set is one of the better Jurassic Park sets.  Each disk contains a lot of extras, many of which are fun to watch.  Fans of the trilogy that have yet to buy the DVDs will find this set a great one to have.

""Jurassic Park"" introduced us to digital dinosaurs and how fearsome they could be with modern computer technology. This movie advanced horror and monster movies in a method similar to the way ""Alien"" advanced science fiction movies. ""Jurassic Park"" immediately became an audience favorite and the new standard by which special effects would be judged. Stephen Spielberg effectively combined in-your-face terror with special effects to keep people at the edge of their seats and in awe of life-like creatures dinosaurs.

""The Lost World"" unfortunately did not measure up to ""Jurassic Park."" Many of the characters were unbelievable and there were too many plot holes that were too readily visible to make the movie enjoyable from beginning to end. While there were several parts of the movie that were well-done, there were at least as many parts where the actions of the characters were unrealistic. The bumps in the actions of the characters just did not allow me to focus on the plot throughout. Another problem with this movie is that it focused too much on action, and very little on the characters themselves. Thus, the movie comes across as more of a cartoon than a horror movie.

""Jurassic Park III"" simplified the plot, added new dinosaurs, and allowed the characters to develop more than ""The Lost World."" The short length of the movie forced the movie to be simpler than the previous movie, and that simplicity makes for a good movie. The best new dinosaur in this movie had to be the pteranodons, though the spinosaur was great also. The characters in this movie generally acted as I would expect them to, and there were fewer outright acts of stupidity. Even the theft of a raptor egg was done in ignorance. So while it was a convenient plot device, you would expect something like that by someone with only minimal knowledge of dinosaurs. I was very happy to see Sam Neill returning in the role of Dr. Alan Grant. His character particularly is very believable.

Enjoy!

170,"	Hospital Horror
 	Hospitals are inherently spooky.  Scenes of so much pain and death, the very walls soaking up the agony through the years, they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there.  The hospital in ""Infection"" (""Kansen"") is in particularly bad shape. Losing money, unable to keep staff, the doctors and nurses working there are under-qualified and desperate.  Into this unstable environment comes a strange patient, with a black, infectious rash.  Slowly, the rash spreads, revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human's body, slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation.  But all is not as it seems, even then.

I'm impressed that, even watching as much J-Horror as I do, ""Infection"" still managed to creep me out.  It was unexpectedly good.  Director Masayuki Ochiai knows the things in a hospital that can make you cringe, and he uses them to their fullest extent.  He also keeps you guessing as to exactly what kind of horror movie this is.  Is it about a devastating biological infection?  Are those ghosts?  Is that a serial killer?  All of his images and slow revelations of the story keep making less and less sense, disorientating you just when you think you have a handle on it, until the final page is revealed and it all comes crashing home.

""Infection"" isn't quite a gross-out flick, like ""Ichi the Killer,"" but it definitely relies on visual shock for its scares while keeping a good atmosphere.  If anything, it manages to combine the creepy mood of J-Horror ghost films like ""Ring"" while still delivering on cringe-worthy gore.  One scene in particular had me going.  When you see the movie, you will know what it was.

As part of the ""J-Horror Theater"" series, and directer by a relatively new-comer who's experience has mainly been doing horror TV shows, I didn't have high expectations for this film.  I thought it would be a cheap job, done to cash in on the current J-Horror fad.  I was wrong. It is quite a well made little horror flick, not outstanding or groundbreaking, but really excellent for what it is

 	At Ikiru's opening, I started to have real doubts about the film. I had heard that this was Kurosawa's best, and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down.

Luckily, that didn't happen.

The narrator of the film reminded me of Criswell's narrations to Plan 9 from Outer Space. The film seemed to say too much and show too little. Then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero Mr. Watanabe at work, something clicked. The long duration of the shot and the narrator's continued breakdown of the man's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives, that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds, and that we are powerless to silence it.

That floored me, and for the rest of the film, I remained awe-stricken by this humble yet miserable man. Takashi Shimura gives one of the greatest performances I've seen since Raging Bull. Here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world, but he's smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt. The horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time.

There are points at which the film seems to drag on, but never without purpose. When he dies, having finally given meaning to his existence, his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity, confusion, and finally admiration. The scene lags, which makes us that much more insulted by their ignorance

173,"	sexy and sharp ""cops and robbers"" film with a twist.....
 	This is a great film that preceded the onset of the ""JLo.""  ""Out of Sight"" is a great showcase for Jennifer Lopez's talent as an actress.  It is a shame that she hasn't been presented with more great roles, like that of Karen Sisco, in this film.  Karen is a D.A, who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude. She has a chance encounter with charming, compulsive bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney).  Their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping of Sisco in her OWN car. It is no surprise that sparks fly.....however, this doesn't downplay the complexities of their star-crossed encounter.  

Some of the greatest strong points of this film include the juxtaposition of flashbacks, incorporating trick camera work and voice overs.  What's more, this film was shot in a very bare bones style.  We don't get a sense of romance, so much as a feeling of stark reality.  The colors are dark, the dialogue between the characters is honest, real and simply wonderful.  This film has a potential for mass appeal, due to the fact that, though it does get gritty and violent, that doesn't downplay its intelligence or originality.  Violence is counterbalanced by genuinely funny scenes, as well as more introspective glimpses at how the characters turned out as they did.  This is definitely a great date film!!

174,"	Out of Sight
 	This was one of the best movies of 1998, but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience.  When I try to think of superlatives to desribe it, the one that keeps coming to mind is ""cool.""

Most of the coolness factor is owed to two things:  Steven Soderbergh's steady directing and the chemistry between the actors, especially George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Back before we knew that Clooney would go on to channel the same character in virtually all of his roles, he defined suave in this movie.  And back before she was J.Lo, Lopez was that IN LIVING COLOR fly girl with the big ole butt trying to make a name for herself as a film actress.  Here she gives the best performance of her career.

While all of the cast (Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks and Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson in cameos) is solid, after Clooney and Lopez the real star is Don Cheadle.  He is quite convincing as the prison boxer Snoopy.  He oozes rage and steals every scene that he's in.

Plots based on books by Elmore Leonard tend to be above average, but are mostly dependent upon the colorful characters he writes.  Thanks to the talent of all involved, this movie is one of the best

Rachel York does a top-notch performance in the leading role. The rest of the cast is up to par. There have been other reviews that say the music is dated, or other such nonsense, but do not pay heed to them. Premiered in 1948, the musical is based on The Taming of the Shrew (Shakespeare),  and the music and lyrics are done by Cole Porter. Sometimes referred to as his masterpiece (which I agree with), the production never drags or disappoints. The lyrics are extremely witty (a trademark of Porter). The music keeps you humming along for days.

183,"	""Very little of life is completely under one's control""
 	Happiness can be delicate. In just one swoop, it can stolen out from under you, just when you least expect it. The results can be often devastating - some can never recover. The family in the Italian film The Son's Room has found such happiness, but when tragedy suddenly strikes, they're engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache.

Grief is perhaps the most tangled of human emotions, and the vagaries of sadness, love, and anger that comprise its essence are often very difficult to portray. Luckily, co-writer, director, and actor Nanni Moretti avoids all the usual clich s in this delicately nuanced and subtly acted film. The Son's Room is indeed a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after sudden death strikes them. 

Moretti stars as Giovanni, a successful psychiatrist with a busy practice treating the assorted neurotics of the picture-perfect Northern Italian coastal town he and his family call home. Giovanni is a mild-mannered and kindly man, who has a sort of passive and submissive approach to living. 

Giovanni also has a lovely family: he's happily married to gorgeous book publisher Paola (Laura Morante) and shares what he considers a close relationship with his teenaged daughter Irene (Jasmine Trinca) and son Andrea (Giuseppe Sanfelice). 

He presides over his wife and two children with a kind of flaccid authority, enveloping them with the same deceptively passive doctoral concern with which he counsels his psychiatric patients. He supports, and heals, less by what he says than by what he doesn't say. He quietly coaches Andrea in soccer moves, while encouraging Irene to be more competitive at basketball. 

Perhaps it's an ominous portent of what is to come, but the film opens as Andrea and his friends have been accused of stealing a valuable fossil from the school's Science department. Giovanni and Paola are surprised to find they entertaining the idea that their son may in fact be guilty as charged. However, no one takes the incident that seriously.

If this is the only drama that affects Giovanni's serene life, nothing prepares him for the sudden tragedy that occurs one sunny Sunday afternoon. Called away from home by a desperate client, Giovanni cancels his plans to go jogging with Andrea; and it's a fatal choice that haunts him for months to come. 
 
The accident, when it happens, is so unexpected. The loss giving rise to sorrow, rage, tenderness, and the inexplicable feeling that hope is no longer possible. The family, emotionally fractured, is unable to continue on. Plunged into unimaginable grief, Giovanni attempts to carry on with his life, but bereft of his objectivity, he finds he's no longer able to function as an analyst.

The Son's Room, with it's subtle acting and its pensive, emotionally layered story, remains a startling testament to the delicate nuances of grief. And it's as though Moretti has invited the viewer to spy on a deeply personal event in the life of a very ordinary family. Like a fly on the wall we witness the sadness, the regret, the empty dinners and the overwhelming feeling of whether they could have done anything to stop the accident. 

Moretti, whose eyes glitter with knowledge from within a bland, bearded, professorial face, gives a wonderful performance, as does the classy Morente as the beautiful, anguished Paola. While Giovanni wanders dazed through a theme park, numb to the grief, Paola fields a desire to talk about the absent child. 

A savior for the family arrives in a letter addressed to the deceased, and when the writer appears on the family's doorstep, she offers the grace note that reminds them of the means by which happiness eventually repairs itself and the unavoidable fact that life goes on. There's no catharsis here, only a heartfelt exploration of what it means to grieve. Mike Leonard August 05.

187,"	I see that ""I Heart the Huckabees"" is meant for a selective audience.
 	This movie is obviously not for everyone. It's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour's. Nope, instead you get the muscle a-cranking. Huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in. This film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart, soul, and body of every other thing in existence in an ever-changing world. This film is a big orgy of questioning. And who doesn't like questioning? This film, in its own right, is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films.

""Huckabees"" offers us an impressive cast with Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jason Schwartzman, Jude Law, Mark Wahlberg, Isabelle Huppert (one of my favorite international actress's) and Naomi Watts. Most notable performances by, namely, Dustin Hoffman as it's nice to see him in an exceptional role. He hasn't really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997's ""Wag the Dog."" It's very nice to see Hoffman play a great character, as Bernard, the quirky husband half of the existential detectives. Also, most notable is the performance of Mark Wahlberg, as Tommy Corn, another client of the detectives that befriends Albert. Tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather, rides a bike to the fire saying, ""We'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum."" Mark Wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Three Kings."" However, this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else. The ensemble's performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless. 

The most credit to this movie goes to writer/director David O. Russell. Russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story. But the story is amazingly written. The script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that.

 	One thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years.  What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now.  In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now.  

Fox had something good cooking with Arrested Development.  It seems whenever a show doesn't get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings.  It VERY rarely works, and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this.  

I can't blame Fox for pulling the plug.  After all, they tried their hardest to promote the show.  I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in.  The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air.  It's just unfortunate people didn't want to watch it.  I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy, Arrested Development would be around today.  

As it stands, 53 episodes are all we have of this great show.  Honestly, it's not enough, but will have to do.  

Do we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies?  Aren't there more than enough of them on the air now?  Most of these shows people won't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there's so many.  Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same, and they blend together.  One plainly obvious joke after another.  I'm bored just thinking about it.  We've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot, and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move, in my opinion.  The times need to change.  

People make a big deal about Arrested Development because there's really NOTHING else like it on television.  That's why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon.  People wouldn't be praising the show so much if there wasn't a good reason for it.  Trust me, there's a reason for all the positive reviews.  Buy one of the DVD season sets, pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, watch the show *carefully* and experience the joy so many people are raving about.

193,"	Teenaged Sexual Repression Captured Vividly by Kazan's Sure Hand and Wood's Best Onscreen Work
 	In the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from Andy Griffith in 1957's ""A Face in the Crowd"", master director Elia Kazan gets similarly stellar results from Natalie Wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920's Kansas. In the same year as her Maria in ""West Side Story"", she has never been more affecting then she is here as Deanie Loomis, the local butcher's daughter deeply in love with Bud Stamper, the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero. They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry, but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents.

The ruling moral code restricts Deanie more than Bud who ends up cavorting with a good-time girl named Juanita. The indiscretion overwhelms Deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state. A few years later with their lives on divergent paths, they meet again to come to terms with each other. While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan's sure hand and William Inge's screenplay (his first directly for the screen), it's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue. Otherwise, there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955's ""Picnic"" based on Inge's successful Broadway play.

At her most beautiful, Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned. As the none-too-bright Bud, Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie's powerful fixation completely understandable. There are several standout performances among the supporting cast with Audrey Christie pitch-perfect as Deanie's unsympathetic mother, Pat Hingle in blowhard mode as Bud's power-hungry father, and Zohra Lampert as Angie, the self-effacing waitress Bud meets at Yale. The classic Wordsworth poem from which the film's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie, and I still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time I see this movie. The 2001 DVD unfortunately has no extras

The DVD offers up a nice selection of extras including Rick Nielson hamming it up for the camera off stage (and on stage of course). Cheap Trick wails and all is right in the world. Now for the negatives from this release. Sound is just okay, after some heavy EQ work I was able to get a very good sound from my Sony 5.1 system, but camera work is indeed lacking. Cameras used for long shots had badly overexposed pictures much of the time and many of the handheld shots were in wrong position, but that may have been an editing problem. All in all I give the performance 5-stars and production 3 stars (a very generous 3-stars).

202,"	Great movie to own, 4 1/2 stars!!
 	This definitely is one of the best movies to own!! If you haven't seen it yet, you should... If you've seen the movie ""Blood In, Blood Out"", then you should definitely see this one... if you haven't seen either one, then i reccommend you buying them both as a combo pack or separately (if you want to save $$)...

I don't know which one i love more out of the two, because i know i've watched each movie more then 30 times... Both movies are pretty similar to each other... but ""Blood In, Blood Out"" kinda focuses on the 3 brothers, and the paths each of them takes, where as ""American Me"" focuses on the paths of the main characters in this movie (like Santana, Puppet, Lil' Puppet, etc).. but not only does it show their lifestyles, but it also focuses on how its having an effect on their families, and how their families feel about the life that their kids are leading... ""American Me"" i think involves more of the family in this picture and culture (La Raza) then ""Blood In, Blood Out"" does... it also shows its origin, like the Pachuco's (Zoot Suit's, Zoot Suit riots).. This movie is pretty close to 5 stars in my book... To me i think it definitely is 1/2 star better then ""Blood In, Blood Out""...becuase this one seems to have alot more of a story line to it, and more characters its focusing on... both in and outside the prison walls..

 	This excellent DVD gives us a remarkable version of Martin Scorsese's film. It has been color corrected by Scorsese himself, and remastered for superior sound quality.
The concert on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 was the final concert of The Band, with its original lineup. Numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion. The Band were clearly at the top of their game that night, despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them. Classic songs like ""Up on Cripple Creek"", ""Stage Fright"",and ""They Night They Drove Old Dixie Down"" are given excellent rendtions. The guest stars seem to be having a good time, with backing by The Band themselves. Ronnie Hawkins does an outstanding ""Who Do You Love"". Dr. John does his classic ""Such A Night"". Joni Mitchell performs her underrated ""Coyote"". A high-kickin' Van Morrison rocks the house with ""Caravan"". And blues legend Muddy Waters does a spectacular ""Mannish Boy"". In a ""making of"" featurette, Scorsese says Waters' perforance of this song was almost not filmed, because most of the cameras ran out of film. Fortunately, one cameraman caught the whole song, so we can have this excellent performance.
 Neil Young, Eric Clapton,and Bob Dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup. Scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of The Band.
 The DVD also incudes two commentaries. One features Scorsese and Robbie Robertson, the other features Levon Helm, Garth Hudson, and guests stars Hawkins and Mavis Staples. They all have good stories to tell, and serve to enhance the film quite well. A previously unseen jam, and an eight page booklet written by Robertson round out the DVD. 
I highly reccomend this DVD to this classic film's many fans

205,"	Cradle Of Crime!
 	Welcome to the Lower East Side, where the high-rise apartments of the super-rich abut the tenements on the riverside. Here Joel McCrea, a poor would-be architect, is infatuated with rich girl Wendy Barrie, while poor girl Sylvia Sidney pines for him, all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets. Into the scene strides Humphrey Bogart as a wanted killer, coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame. Intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the Dead End Kids (in what would be the first of many screen appearances), of which Sidney's brother is the leader.

The film is based on a play, and boy can you tell. The studio set is deeply obvious as such, and the structure is too carefully symmetrical. The social symbolism is subtle as a sledgehammer, and the script is too caught up with being Worthy. Bogart's performance is a striking one, however, and his character stands out as fully realized when compared to the walking Social Messages incarnated by Sidney and McCrea. The Dead End Kids (also known as the East Side Kids, the Bowery Boys, and the Little Tough Guys) would show again the following year in Angels with Dirty Faces, and viewing the two films together is instructive, showing, among other things, the difference between MGM's gloss (which sat uneasily on a gangster story) and Warner's far more convincing grit.

The mono track is in good shape. The print is in pretty good shape, but there's no hiding the fact that this is a film from 1937. The trailer is here, and nothing else. The menu is basic.

Once celebrated with Oscar nominations, this film now seems rather silly compared to the Warner gangster films of the same period. But it has a definite historical value, and certainly deserves its release

208,"	Once and Future Hamlet
 	Brilliant is an often overworked phrase, but in the case of *Hamlet* starring Mel Gibson, the word cannot be used enough.  For brevity's sake, I will save Zeffirelli's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing.  This review is for Chris Devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult Shakespeare script.  Devore somehow makes it better.  Were he in London, late 1500's, he would have been a collaborator, making Will's work the pearl it is today.  My only plea is that, at some date, we will get to see Gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared.

This may have been Glenn Close's best work.  This is not a complaint, but rather a sign that anyting else she may have or has done cannot be any better than this wonderful, small role.  Ophelia (Close) has an important commentary that must be heard in order for the play to work - Will was no fool - and it needs a Close to do it.

Alan Bates has been a staple of English theatre and screen and has delivered many fine parts (such as Gabriel Oaks in *Far From the Madding Crowd*, 1967).  As Claudius, the regicide and brother of Hamlet, Senior, Bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble except for that one small cancer, that flaw in his character - very clintonian and very believable.

I have wanted to kick Ian Holm's ever since Ash hurt Ripley in *Alien*, 1979.  I have to keep reminding myself that he really is that believable and that I really don't hate him, It's the character he has created so well.  His body of work is repleat with characters of such believability that you forget his name - IAN HOLM - until he does it again, the next time, in the next movie.  If films were strictly Hasidic, Holm's version of Polonius would be Kosher.  There is not one piece of ham in his entire performance. It is worth the purchase of the DVD just to see him act.

Everyone is good in the movie and there is not time to talk about all of them.  But a note to those whose noses are airbourne and won't tolerate anyone but Olivier as Hamlet.  There are several uneven performances in his excellent movie.  There are no uneven performances in this piece.

Finally, we come to the mad prince of Denmark.  It is most astonishing that I watched this epic again after Mel's dark night of the troll, thrashing about in complete insanity, arguably brought on by hard likker, frustration, and stupidity.  Yet with all said, Gibson IS the essential Hamlet.  You will find no other actor who delivers the goods the way the Cruiser from the Boozer does.

You know this is true, not just by watching the exquisite performance on the DVD, but by Gibson's own marvelling at what was accomplished, not because of some actor's raison d'etre, but rather by the actor's very ability to understand that he is dealing with things that go beyond the ken of normal humans.  IS Hamlet crazy, or crazy like a fox?  And when is he crazy we get to hear Mel say in the devastating interview he made for the DVD release many years gone by.

So, enough from me.

If you want to see the best Hamlet ever, buy this DVD and feast.

As Claudius, the regicide and brother of Hamlet Senior, Bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble, except for that one small cancerous tumour, that character flaw - very clinical and very credible. I've wanted to kick Ian Holm since Ash Ripley got injured in 1979. I have to keep reminding myself that he is really so believable and that I really don't hate him, it's the character he created so well. His work is full of characters of such credibility that you forget his name - IAN HOLM - until he does it again in the next film, next time. If movies were strictly Hasidic, Holm's version of Polonius would be kosher. There is not a single piece of ham in his entire performance."

 	Harvey Milk was the elected supervisor of District 6 in San Francisco when he was murdered--along with Mayor George Moscone on November 27, 1978, by fellow supervisor, Dan White (who later claimed the infamous ""Twinkie defense""). The film ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" firmly places the murder of Milk, a gay politician, into the politically significant context of the times. The crime, the verdict, and the sentence served were all shocking. This film tells the story behind the headlines. 

Milk was a stockbroker on the East Coast, when he decided to pull up roots and head for San Francisco. He opened a camera shop on Castro Street and quickly earned the name of ""Mayor of Castro Street"" for his enthusiastic community involvement. His interest led to several failed attempts to run for city office, but when the city's elections ran by district--rather than citywide--Milk became the newly elected supervisor for the Sixth District. Milk's enthusiasm and talent for politics thrived in city hall. 

The film includes photographs, newsreel footage, and many interviews with those who crossed Milk's path in a professional or personal capacity. Milk was passionate about public transportation, rent control, and the rights of seniors and gays. White, on the other hand, found San Francisco's Gay Day ""obscene."" Eerily, there are several photos of Milk that also include his killer--clean cut, ex-fireman and family man, Supervisor Dan White. The film explores the flavour of the times--San Francisco was becoming a gay Mecca, and there were some people who couldn't adjust to that fact. Senator John Briggs, who called San Francisco ""the moral garbage dump of the nation"" was fighting to get a proposition put on the ballot that would allow gay teachers to be fired. Milk fought this ballot tooth and nail, and it failed. 

The film ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" includes two discs. One disc contains the film, and the other disc is packed with extra features--including coverage of the film's premiere in Castro Street, a Dan White update, 1st and 25th anniversary events of the crime, director's commentary, the Academy Awards 1985, and a photo gallery. For those of us who remember the headlines, ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" is a fascinating documentary that places the crime firmly in the context of its time--displacedhuma

210,"	The abyss of drug addiction
 	The Danny Boyle directed ""Trainspotting"" was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of Scottish heroin addicted losers.  While the film garnered accolades, I found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted.  Ewan McGregor playing Mark Renton and his crew which included ""Full Monty"" star Robert Carlyle, as violent psycho Begbie, swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high.

Congregating in a filthy, deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high.  As a group they're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix.

McGregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies.  Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories.  In a humorous scene, cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories.  He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them.

McGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations, escaping to London and working as a realtor.  His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life.

McGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true,........the big drug deal.  They manage to complete the deal for 16,000 pounds which McGregor decides to steal.  He intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew.  Fat chance

215,"	""I'm Gonna Be Like Joan Collins And You Aint Gonna Stop me!""
 	I cannot recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie, which is my favourite from the 1980's by far. The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in ""Big Business"",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood's Golden Age. A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory. The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in ""Big Business"", it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York's business world.

The story begins in a flash back when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton are passing through rural backwater Jupitor Hollow when Binky goes into labour. At the same time locals Garth and Iona Ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of Sadie and Rose but are also mixed up. We move forward forty years to where Sadie Shelton is the corporate head of Moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of Holomade, the local industry in Jupitor Hollow. Getting wind of their plans the militant Jupitor Hollow resident Rose Ratliff decides to go fight these ""Pinstriped Trouser Snakes"", on their own territory and Sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring Jupitor Hollow. Through a mix up they end up staying in the Plaza Hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as ""sinks in the living room"", and ""soaps in the shapes of swans""! Complication piles on top of complication as Sadie Shelton's ex husband Michael (Barry Primus), can't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural Sadie for his hard nosed wife and Jay Marshall(Michael Gross), can't for the life of him understand why Rose (Ratliff) is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure Rose (Shelton). All comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two Sadie's are really the city Sheltons while the two Rose's are really the twins meant to be in Jupitor Hollow. The fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when Sadie (Shelton), is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to Sadie (Ratliff), to put all her watching of her idol Alexis Carrington in ""Dynasty"", to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing Jupitor Hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully. 

Classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins, on the classic 1960's comedy series ""The Patty Duke Show"". I dont think I've ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in ""Big Business"". Her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails Sadie Shelton who's all ""hostile takeovers"" to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin Sadie Ratliff who only wants to be able to say ""keep the change!"" is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter. Her classic mirror sequence with her ""twin"", is a total riot and her statement that ""this whole thing has got UFO written all over it!"",will have you breaking up with laughter. Equally Lily Tomlin as both country activist Rose Ratcliff, ""I'm gonna go kick some snooty New York Ass!"", and as Rose Shelton the awkward out of place city girl ""I hate shopping and I hate New York in June!"",is also top rate. Her rejection of Jay's engagement ring as a supposed ""bribe"" and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a ""great big belly scraping pile of cow plop!"", is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene I never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening I have of this movie. Of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at New York's Plaza Hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up. Two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk's (Joe Grifasi), continual mixing up of Sadie Shelton/Ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined, and especially Fabio Alberici's (Michele Placido), total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers, the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone! The hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women (one from the country and the other from the city), seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff. It is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first. Classics like: ""Im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease!"",""Oh my God it's so COSMOpolitan"", ""Oh sure its full of crowds, smog, sex fiends, and white slavers, it's a pistol, I've got about as much use for it (New York), as a Toad has for spit pearls!"", ""Computer chips, they've got their ways!"", and ""Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase?"", are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script. 

Total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more. It is a real pity that ""Big Business"", so far has marked the only time that Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle. This film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages. I've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as I am! So I'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven't already. You wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends, in Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in ""Big Business"". Enjoy!

217,"	a must-see
 	This documentary gives a brief introduction to Al-Jazeera, which, if you didn't know already, is the main arab language newschannel. It is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it's willingness to go where other, stated-owned and controlled arab networks won't tread. In this sense it is more than a mere arab CNN in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media.

The filmmakers here interview Al-Jazeera personel, as well as some american journalists, and the american official which liases with Al-Jazeera for Centcom, the american Central Command in the present Irak war (which happens to be 30 miles from Al Jazeera headquarters). It covers the timeline from just before the war, to just after Bush anounced main millitary operations to be over. 

By striving to be neutral, the documentary allows you to see how Al-Jazeera see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world. They are very disappointed in the United States, but adhere strongly to its values. 

Also interesting is how being ""on the arab side"" gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values, like when they are angered by Pentagon protests at their having showed images of US prisoners, when western media routinely show Iraki POWs.

An unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be. The american liaison doesn't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source, and as if that weren't enough, he is barely articulate in english and clearly doesn't know anything about the local context and history. Another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials, but doesn't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists, irritating the very people they are trying to win over.

All in all it's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds. It gets four stars rather than five because of it's sometimes amateurish handling of flow, which makes it at times a bit unfocused

 	I woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of Fellini Satyricon.  Someone is mortally wounded, the blonde guy?  And lies there dying, watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired, Gitone, and some dancing leaping black guy....  I think.  
   I've seen it probably 9 times, it always was a favorite when I was a teen and older, but I haven't seen it for years.  But it was so visually entrancing, and so truly pre-Christian -- that is, made from that standpoint, which movies seldom are or can be!  
    I just remember the wonderul images, a boat rising in the mist, the strange tenement bldg they (Ascylto and Encolpio) live in, the sea monster, the bacchanale, the hermaphrodite's cavern, the Minotaur.....  endless, splendid, dreamlike images on and on....
  [I wonder why it is Italians are such master of the visual in this manner; I think of Visconti, Antonioni, even Scorsese and the American-Italians -- maybe it's that Renaissance artist legacy?]

From my buddy:  Like you, I saw it a few times, decades ago.  The images are so strong and mysterious. Images that render volumes of emotions that are so deep, echoing a memory that is never realized. Modern day, Scorsese manages it. Zefferelli too.
That is true film-making. Even the older films from De Sica capture images that are unforgettable. Wells has done it.
But what you're talking about, is, I suppose, secular in nature. Icons derived from the human experience that has meaning from within the human soul. Not from an outward omnipresence of theology.  Satyricon is almost existential, as a presentation of true human nature. Done with frame-paintings. And framed in such a way that is evocative.  Amazing dream art!

 	This is too good to be true.  After purchasing this based on reviews alone my partner and I sat down to watch it not knowing what was about to take place.  For the next three hours, we were absolutely shocked and entertained.  This has got to be one of the most original shows ever to be created.  Its got it all; comedy, drama and twisted minds.

227,"	There are more than two points in the spectrum
 	More than ""male"" and ""female"". More than your view or her view or my view or any one person's view of what makes ""male"" and what makes ""female"" and everything in between. Sexuality (gay, straight, bi, asexual, etc) is different than gender (male/female) and can have nothing and yet sometimes everything to do with the other.

There are gay men and straight me and bisexual men, too. Whatever they identify as has no impact on whether they are also transsexual and seek re-assignment into a body that fits them more. It's not some sick fetish or crazy delusion. Surgery, hormones, these are RISKY! And they would not be undertaken unless other options HAD been explored and found unable to cease the ache inside.

Gender Identity Disorder (GID) is real. Transition (the process of taking hormones, living as the preferred gender in all things, surgery, etc) is not a CURE but it can make life bearable.

And I think it's funny that still male to female transsexuals are regarded more often as ""real"" and the female to male transsexuals are ignored. 

Raci has known she was trans it appears most of her life. She started taking hormones while she was still in what should have been her male puberty. So, of COURSE she looks ""more feminine"" but that doesn't make her any more or less of a ""real woman"" than the other MTF, Gabbie. Gabbie is a lesbian while Raci is straight. See how this works? Gabbie likes women, Raci likes men. It has nothing to do with one being ""right"" and one being ""wrong"".

There is a world of difference between a man relating to a woman and a woman relating to a woman. Just as a man relating to a man vs. a man relating to a woman. And it's not all sexual. It is entirely plausible that a man would transition into a woman and still be attracted to women. Hello, the gender changed, not who they were attracted to! 

I'm just so tired of seeing so many people picking apart transsexuals. We are not here for your amusement. We are not here to be some star in your porn show. We are real. And these kids do an amazing job showing that. But I see that the majority of reviewers are more wound up over the ""sick fetishes"" and one MTF being more female convincing than the other. 

I would love to see the same folks who brought us this (a more emotional struggle) to also do one documenting the physical changes that happen and how FTMs, in particular, struggle with the emotional effects of T.

 	This is probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Those who don't think it's funny are those who are easily offended.  If you are easily offended or politically correct you probably won't enjoy this film.

Having said that, if you like vampires you won't necessarily dislike this film.  I completely disagree with the reviewer who said ""If you like vampires, you will not like this movie."" That's crap.  I love vampires/vampire movies and I loved this movie.  Believe it or not, not all vampire fans are two-dimensional, some of us are actually well rounded.

The person who compared it to Polanski's ""Repulsion"" needs to get away from the bong.  While both deal with mental insanity, the same can be said about a lot of films.  ""Repulsion"" was just disturbing and weird, and not overly entertaining.  (Polanski's work is highly overrated and pretentious.  We watch films to be entertained, not to have whatever it is Polanski tries to pull.)

Having said all this, this is definitely not a film for everyone.  It was way ahead of it's time when it was made.  Had it been made now, there would likely be a huge cult following behind it...but then again, maybe not.  As liberal as most like to imagine themselves, we still live in a country of highly uptight people, easily offended, and unable to laugh at the things we fear or find disturbing.

If you've got a sick sense of humor, add this to your video library, because if you aren't going to be able to laugh at it, you aren't going to enjoy it.

 	One of the many hit TV shows inextricably linked to the 1980's is The A-Team, an action series with plenty of bombs, machine guns, and bazookas - where miraculously no one ever seems to die! Short for ""Alpha Team,"" The A-Team is a Vietnam-era crack commando unit wrongfully accused of robbing the Bank of Hanoi. Having escaped from a maximum security prison, the four man team survives in the anonymity of the Los Angeles underground. And with the government still hot on their trail, they're forced to work as soldiers of fortune, providing aid and assistance to the helpless victims of various injustices... 

The A-Team is led by cigar aficionado Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith (George Peppard), a wise-cracking officer who always has a plan in the works. Hannibal is flanked by Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck (Dirk Benedict), the consummate ladies' man; Sgt. Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus (Mr. T), a gold-drenched muscleman afraid of flying; and Captain H.M ""Howling Mad"" Murdock, a lanky mental case who nevertheless carries out his missions with flawless precision. Together, they travel the country in B.A.'s trademark black van, fighting for justice and attempting to elude the clutches of the nefarious Colonel Decker (Lance LeGault) who wants nothing more in life than to capture The A-Team... 

The A-Team (Season 1) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere ""Mexican Slayride"" in which journalist Amy Allen sets out to prove the existence of The A-Team and its various good deeds. But when a fellow reporter is kidnapped by Mexican renegades, Amy gets a firsthand look at The A-Team's handiwork when she hires them to rescue her friend... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Holiday in the Hills"" in which, following a plane crash, The A-Team is forced to do battle with a group of mountain men, and ""One More Time"" in which the U.S. government itself hires The A-Team to rescue a general and his daughter from South American guerillas...

 	It is nice to see Bebe Neuwirth in something other than Cheers.

Oscar (Aaron Stanford) is too sophisticated for girls his age but not for his stepmother (Sigourney Weaver) and Bebe Neuwirth (the seductress). Women are all over him. His stepmom ignores him and chiropractor thinks she finds the romantic she's always dreamed of. The joking innuendos are quite hilarious reminding me of the Graduate. Gary Winnick (the director) shot this movie on a digital camera in two weeks and won raves at the festivals.

The little captions before or after a scene kinda tell you how Oscar is working or getting worked over. John Ritter (Dad, apparently serious but funny) and the whole cast gives strong performances certainly earning their street creed.

You'll find charming nuggets of truth in this movie, quite a bit of wit, and hilarity. Sure, Oscar is 15 and, rather than opening his eyes to girls, they open his. His daydreams about his stepmom are electrifyingly filmed.

As for the morality, I think people are a little paranoid over this taut, striking film. If you are openminded, you'll find this film is more about coming of age than what narrow minded people think. It is a light film to the touch and men will probably be reliving high school fantasies about the older woman. Women will like it because it shows how men are nothing more than putty in their hands. It is just amazing how much depth this film has in 77 minutes!

And Ice Cube as Calvin who owns the shop ain't so bad himself, although he sure has to frown a lot.

Well, he's got troubles right here in the Windy City.  He's always got an entrepreneurial scheme up his sleeve that just doesn't quite work out which causes him to fall behind in his property taxes.  Now this might not be such a big deal but the barbershop has been in his family for three generations and it serves as a kind of neighborhood club where people can hang out and shoot the breeze.  It's a beloved kind of place.  Enter Lester Wallace the loan shark with muscle who makes Calvin an offer he can't refuse.  Well, he does refuse it or at least he tries, but Wallace ain't the kind of dude to take a refusal.

Can Calvin save the barbershop?  That's the question of the main plot line, but what really makes this movie such a treat are the barbershop mini-stories that are neatly tied together and the fine repartee.  And what makes THAT work is that everything in the film is seen from a point of view inside the black community and not from somebody else looking in (which never works, but is often tried).

247,"	Amazing Box Set Collects Some of the Finest Film Performances of Mid-20th Century American Cinema
 	If playwright Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of O'Neill or his closest contemporary Arthur Miller, they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters. This is clearly evidenced in this six-film, eight-disc collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of Hollywood in the 1950's and early 1960's, all directed by true filmmaking masters. Probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now, the best of the set are Elia Kazan's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and John Huston's ""The Night of the Iguana"". The others are Kazan's ""Baby Doll"", Richard Brooks' ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", Jose Quintero's ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" and Brooks' ""Sweet Bird of Youth"". 

A feral, smoldering Marlon Brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish Stanley Kowalski in 1951's ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen. Intriguingly, one of the extras included in the two-disc set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of Brando when he was 23, and his stardom seems assured even then. The plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between Kowalski and his visiting sister-in-law, Blanche DuBois, a fading Southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown. Having proven her ability to be a convincing Southerner in ""Gone With the Wind"", Vivien Leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability.

Strong supporting work comes from Kim Hunter as Blanche's naive sister Stella and Karl Malden as Blanche's seemingly respectful suitor Mitch. Now over ninety, Malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track, and film historians Rudy Behlmer and Jeff Young provide more objective commentary on another track. Film critic Richard Schickel's 1995 feature-length look at Kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk, and there is also a more interesting five-part documentary on the film and original Broadway show, the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the DVD version of the film.

1964's ""The Night of the Iguana"" deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people, but this time the setting is a dilapidated Mexican beach resort where Reverend Shannon, newly defrocked, has taken a group of spinsters from a women's college. Huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations, and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations, striking visuals and dark humor. Richard Burton is in peak form as Shannon, and there is also sterling work from Deborah Kerr as the spinsterish Hannah and especially Ava Gardner as the slatternly resort owner, Maxine Faulk. The DVD contains a recent making-of featurette and a vintage video, both fascinating.

""Baby Doll"" is an entertaining hoot that doesn't seem as sensationalistic as I'm sure it was when the film was first released in 1956. It's simply a Southern-fried farce about the potential deflowering of a nineteen-year old child bride with a nice, pouty turn by Carroll Baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by Karl Malden as her randy husband, cotton mill owner Archie. 1958's ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of Brick as an asexual protagonist, this in spite of stellar performances from Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives.

Newman is even better as gigolo Chance Wayne in 1963's ""Sweet Bird of Youth"", and he is matched all the way by Geraldine Page's all-cylinders-on performance as faded movie queen Alexandra Del Lago (a role that would have ironically been ideal for Ava Gardner). The weakest film of the set is 1961's ""The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone"" about an aging American actress living in Rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo. A decade after ""Streetcar"", the glamorous-looking Leigh excels in the title role, while a young Warren Beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo Paolo even though his faux-Italian accent is a little too emphatic. All four of these movies come with making-of featurettes and original trailers, and ""Cat"" also includes commentary from Williams' biographer Donald Spoto.

The focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary, ""Tennessee Williams' South"", which highlights insightful interviews with Williams in the New Orleans area. The film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary. You can have the privilege of seeing Broadway's original Blanche DuBois, Jessica Tandy, and compare her work to Leigh's, as well as an impressive turn by Maureen Stapleton as Amanda Wingfield in ""The Glass Menagerie"". This is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of mid-20th century American cinema

253,"	Get down and give me 20!
 	Although I enjoy Pilates and yoga, I need a good workout that makes me sweat.  Boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose.  But there are times where I prefer to feel the burn at home.  To that end, one of the best cardio/strength DVD workouts I've found is ""Crunch: Boot Camp Training.""  

The workout runs for about 30 minutes, which is great for those days where I want a shorter (but still effective) one.  It's short because exercises are combined together in order to minimize time and maximize benefit.  For example, three-to-ten pound hand weights are used to work the upper body while doing squats and lunges.  Abs and obliques are worked on the floor with different types of crunches, and during standing cardio work by side knee lifts.  Of course, a boot camp workout would be incomplete without pushups - there are three sets, each with a different emphasis to shake things up (and the lower body is worked in as well).  A cooldown/stretch session concludes the proceedings.

As for the instructor, Susan Hitzmann is one of the best I've seen on a DVD workout.  She has an infectious enthusiasm that challenges and encourages at the same time.  She calls well, using a clear and authoritative voice.  I also enjoyed the chemistry between her and the rest of the class.  This is one of the few DVD workouts where I can identify with the assistants, because they look like they are actually working out.  They moan, groan, and laugh like real people, and plastic smiles are kept to a minimum.  Finally, the generic accompanying music complements the workout without overwhelming it.

There are two caveats for ""Crunch: Boot Camp Training.""  First, it might be hard on someone with sensitive knees because there are a lot of squats and forward lunges.  I had an ACL recon years ago, so I usually do backward lunges in place of the forward ones (the workout also features backward lunges).  Also, the routine's fast pace and combinations may confuse or wear out beginners.  But easier variations are demonstrated by a woman on the instructor's left side, so this is a workout you can grow into.  Even so, if your body takes time to get limber due to age or previous injury, you may want to warm up on your own beforehand.  

""Crunch: Boot Camp Training"" is an excellent boot camp-style home workout.  I own a large number of exercise DVDs, and this one's on my go-to stack.  Highly recommended

 	What do I think of when someone says ""Disney!""? Hmmm...kiddy films, girly stuff, princess(groan, we don't need more of that!), dreams come true and...cheesy?
Yep, all of the things above are in Ice Princess, with some fresh twists. With the ""mean rival"" changed to ""nice rival"", and add ""with hard work"" after ""dreams come true"". I mean, look at Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what did they do to make their dreams come true, which is a pathetic one, to marry a prince? One had a 100-year beauty sleep and the other had a fairy-godmother to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand! Casey Carlyle was totally different. I agree with people, that it's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I give this film a 4 and not a 5. But it's an improvement.
The cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done, and while people on IMDB say that they're to showy, it is true, but aww, come on, this is a movie, not a real competition, and everybody likes some nice ice-skating in movies.
The acting is great, especially Michelle Trachtenberg and Hayden Panettiere. Michelle's acting is really good, and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements. Hayden Panettiere's acting is also good, but it's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and ""Mary-Sue""ish. ""Mary-Sue""ish would mean that she's almost perfect.

 	To have these three classics for this low price is fantastic. One film is the 1938 version of the classic Christmas Carol this one starring Reginald Owen as a very respectable Scrooge. If you can refrain from comparing him to Alastair Sim, you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of Scrooge, and it is a fine one. Owen is truly miserly and wretched, as befits Scrooge, and very believable. The overall production is wonderful, the only drawback was the casting of Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim...WAY over the top, to the point where he is annoying. But all in all, a great version, and Ann Rutherford as the Ghost of Christmas Past is fascinating.
Christmas in Connecticut is very satisfying; a real new England Christmas, with Barbara Stanwyck in one of her lighter roles. This is enjoyable for those who are alone over the Holidays and a great film to watch with family for those who will have a traditional Holiday, with family and friends.
I saved the best for last...Boys Town.
This is absolutely one of my all-time favorites, with Mickey Rooney in one of his definitve, cocky wise-guy roles. No one could touch a Mickey Rooney performance in this type of role; he cornered the brash market...as he proves in this movie. It is a real treat to watch him interact with Spencer Tracy, THE finest actor Hollywood has ever produced, IMO. He has dignity, he commands respect simply by virtue of his own quiet, firm presence.
The other boys were great complements to the production; all very natural, and Bobs Watson particularly heart-breaking in his role; what a great actor he was! (If you can find a copy, see him with Cedric Hardwicke and Lionel Barrymore in ""On Borrowed Time"", a REAL tear-jerker.)
I wish I could have been on the set of this one! They must have had a ball. When I saw it, as a child, I thought it was a movie, therefore fantasy, and not real; when I found out that Father Flanagan was indeed real, as was Boys Town, it gave the movie even more of a dimension and interest. His tenet, ""There is no such thing as a bad boy"", is touching in its simplicity and pure, simple faith. Father Flanagan's secret for success with even the most recalcitrant youth was this faith and his refusal to accept any boy's lack of self-esteem or belief in himself; with FF ALL things were possible.
When Spencer Tracy was voted best Actor at the Academy Awards that year, he became the first actor to win the award two years in a row...the first was for his part as Manuel, in ""Captains Courageous."" Being the gracious, wonderful man he was, he accepted his award with extreme humility, and gave it to Father Flanagan, whom he highlighted in his acceptance speech.
This movie has drama, excitement and some very funny moments and shows the amazing versatility of a very young Mickey Rooney. A truly great buy

This is pleasant for those who are alone over the holidays, and a great movie to watch with the family for those who will have a traditional holiday, with family and friends. I saved the best for last... Boys Town. That's absolutely one of my all-time favourites, with Mickey Rooney in one of his definitive, swaggering roles as a smart guy. No one could touch a Mickey Rooney in that kind of role; he cornered the naughty market... as he proves in this film. It's a real treat to watch him interact with Spencer Tracy, the best actor Hollywood has ever produced, and he's a wonderful man. He has dignity, he commands respect purely by virtue of his own quiet, firm presence. The other guys were great additions to the production; all very natural, and Bob Watson in his role especially heartbreaking; what a great actor he was! (If you find a copy, watch him with Cedric Hardwicke and Lionel Barrymore in ""On Borrowed Time,"" a REAL tear-jerker.) I wish I could have been on the set of that movie!"
259,"	When old-fashioned lessons came in sweet packages!
 	I first saw this as a child during an ""afternoon movie"" event at my gradeschool.  Little did I understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting, nor did I appreciate the subtle moral of the film, namely that good guys sometimes do finish first, by the very nature of their untainted goodness.

Oh, sure, I rooted for Charlie and his uncle, the poorest of the poor, simply trying to make ends meet.  And who didn't despise Veruca Salt, the bratty English tart--with a pushover for a father--who acted like the world was her private oyster?

But having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter, I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is, even in our age of CG film wizardry.  And without having seen the new version, I can't help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon, Willy Wonka.

More impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward, old-fashioned morality tales with universal appeal.  Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film, including gluttony, vanity, greed, and avarice; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike.

The lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated, and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film, or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?

I'll have to check it out.  Meanwhile, see the classic, and be charmed all over again

The Plot is pure ham and cheese. A whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for Dracula, Frankenstein,The Werewolf of Paris, and The Mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life.( I told you it was stupid)Before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height.If you can accept a movie on the level of a Police Academy or Earnest goes to Camp then you should not have a problem with this. Only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like Camp Blood this is a masterpiece

261,"	Warm and Sweet like a cup of hot chocolate
 	This is a warm-hearted, sweet story based on the Cinderella fairy tale. Only we have Sam, a young girl who works at a diner once owned by her father and taken over by her wicked stepmother when he dies in an earthquake. Sam carries on a secret email/chat romance with the most popular boy in her high school, but she doesn't know the identity of her Prince Charming.

Jennifer Coolidge was a scream as the Botoxed, cosmetically enhanced, tackily dressed wicked stepmother. She was hilarious in ""Legally Blonde"", but really goes all out for this role. Quite a scene stealer was Madeline Zima as one of the two wicked stepsisters. Hilary Duff is her usual adorable, perky blonde self and is a delight to watch.

One of the funniest moments for me was at the diner that was redecorated into a pepto-bismol fifties motif by the stepmother. The poor waitresses were all required to wear pink cashmere sweaters, pearls, a poodle skirt with petticoats and roller skates. If that isn't hard enough, the waitresses had to spin as they served people or picked up orders. I love when funny bits like this are slipped into movies. One can just see Jennifer Coolidge's wicked stepmother character instructing these poor waitresses on how to twirl as they served customers.

This is a GREAT family film. Although I don't have children yet, I enjoy this film as a break from all the intense films aimed at adults. It is light-hearted fluff, but very enjoyable, like a cup of hot chocolate. Included on the DVD is Hallie's and Hilary's music video of ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" and a bunch of other special features as well.

263,"	Realistic, Yet Hopeless War Story.
 	Based upon director and writer Oliver Stone's own experiences in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict.  The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier's soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.

Despite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone's best movie to date.  Stone's direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.  The film contains fine performances: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity, despite the deep metaphysical connotations.  PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.

I was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.  I've never been in battle myself, but I do know that war is hell.  Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to agree with the film's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one's soul to evil.  Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.  This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well (though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATER RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS)
",1,"Realistic but hopeless war story. Based on the personal experiences of director and screenwriter Oliver Stone in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major film about the war directed by a veteran of the conflict. The film is about a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the train he lives and fights on during his business trip. The battle rows are very coarse, graphic and realistic. Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Peak. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. n. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews. Grodin stands for all that is good and noble and worth fighting for, while Barnes stands for the evil and ugliness of war. So, at its core, PLATOON is a film about the internal war for the soul of a soldier between good and evil.

 	Clueless has been released on DVD before, with nothing more than two theatrical trailers as bonus features.

The transfer on this DVD is AWESOME. It's very clean, sharp, and clear. I don't remember any issues on the past DVD, but if there were any, it seems like they were cleared up for this release.

The bonus features are likeable fluff, but at least they're existent. Featuring new interviews with several cast and crew members, such featurettes as ""The Class of '95,"" which discusses the cast, and ""Language Arts,"" which discusses the many phrases that this movie brought to our pop culture lexicon, allow us to delve, if only just slightly, into the making and the impact of this movie. Also, the trailers from the previous DVD release are included.

Children of the 90's definitely need to own this DVD. Clueless is still a major part of America's pop culture today, and really, who doesn't love watching a 90's teen comedy remake of a literary classic like Jane Austen's Emma

The scene when Marik talks to his brother for the last time (or so he thinks at that moment) is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime I've seen. If only the voice actor sounded like Marik's age for once and kept the poignant music. And didn't use the gold stuff when someone's mind is snatched.

The scene in which Marik talks to his brother for the last time (at least that's what he thinks at the moment) is one of the most beautiful drawings I've ever seen. If only the dubbing voice-over would sound like Marik's age and keep the poignant music. And not the gold used when someone's mind is snatched away.

282,"	The basic techniques
 	This DVD contains the basic techniques of Krav maga system. The techniques include attacks with hands (mostly punches with closed fist, but also hammer punches), elbows, knees and feet. There are some counterattacks and defences also included. At the beginning of the film they talk about angles of attack, target areas and stance  and  movement. As a DVD extra, they present focus mitt combinations to utilize in your training (they mention that they will produce an entire film on the subject in the future).

It is worth mentioning that they don't teach, or even mention the correct falling technique at all. Also, I think they should have taught also palm strikes, but for some reason they were left out. As palm strike is almost as effective as punch with a closed fist, but much more safe for your own hand, it should be included in everyones' arsenal. When instructing kicking techniques, they mention casually that you can kick also to the head. I think that they should have warned against that, because in real life, kicking above your own waist is considered risky, and generally not advisable.

The presentation of techniques varies from fair to excellent, the average being of good quality. In some techniques I learned some nuances I had not grasped in my Krav maga classes. Each technique opens up with a dramatized scene in which the technique is used. After that they present the technique at full speed, and after that in slow motion, and finally in learning stages. For some reason, they have chosen not to use slow motion of a full speed presentation of technique. Rather, the person presenting the technique is moving in slow motion, according to the instructions of off-screen narrator. This makes somewhat amateurish impression of the production.

Speaking of production, it is fairly OK. The film is shot with only one camera, but for the most part, it is shooting at the right spot. The techniques are presented in a studio against a black screen, but the dramatized scenes are shot in loading docks, restaurants, parking lots and so on. They use two narrators who take turns with narrating the techniques. The other narrator is International Krav maga federation head instructor Eyal Yanilov, and the other is U.S. chief instructor Darren Levine. Yanilov does not speak very good English, so from time to time it is hard to grasp what he is saying. Otherwise the production is good, and it's easy to understand the techniques.

As a Krav maga practitioner myself, I like the system. In this film, they have succeeded in presenting the basic techniques very well. There are some shortcomings, though, that reduce one star from the rating of this film.

286,"	Jefferson Smith  ~  ""Champion Of Lost Causes""
 	'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is a classic Frank Capra film from '39. Starring a stellar cast of some of Hollywood's best from the ""Golden Age"" of cinema it's not only one of the greatest films of that era, but a fascinating time capsule view into a time when patriotism and love of America was something to be proud of, not mocked. Yes it's overly sentimental and at times almost laughable in its blatant pandering to our emotions, however it has survived the test of time and now some 67 years since its release it can still melt the heart of even the most jaded among us.

Can the young and naive Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart) survive in the United States capital as a newly appointed Senator? Will he check his ideals and values at the door and play the political game or will he stand up for what's right against the ""powers that be?"" If you're any kind of movie buff you already know the answer.

One of Capra's and Stewart's best and definitely one of the Essentials to any DVD collection!

291,"	Only the French can make movies like this
 	I almost gave up on this one forty minutes in.  Don't you do that.  The ending is superb.

Premise: working class girl gets dumped by her boyfriend and seeks work by housekeeping.

Well, that can lead to something better if you keep house for the right person.

Jacques (Jean-Pierre Bacri) who recently got walked out on by his wife, and who, not so incidentally looks sixty--well, fifty-five--(actually he was barely fifty when this was made, but you get the point) gets his ad for a housekeeper answered by Laura (Emilie Dequenne) who is twentysomething--a young twentysomething.

I guess there is not much else to say, and to be honest I decided I would force myself to watch the inevitable.  But the director is Claude Berri who directed two of the best movies I ever saw: Manon of the Spring (1986) and Jean De Florette (1986).

And so I stayed with it.  At about the fifty minute mark the movie started to get interesting.  I could feel that old guy/young girl love affair was going to take an unexpected fork in the road.  (As Yogi said, if you come to a fork in the road, take it.  The players have no choice.)  Obviously, old guy/young girl can end only one way: young girl leaves old guy for young guy.  This is biology.  It will be painful.

Claude Berri knows all this, and probably a lot better than I do.  And so guess what?

Well, I won't tell.  But you will find that the last thirty-some minutes of this sexy romantic comedy delightful, and especially the very, very clever and most satisfying ending.

Just prior to that Laura asks Jacques for his blessing.  He won't give it, but she is right: he should.  And then when we get the final ""life is so...lifelike"" grimace on Jacques's face, we can only smile.

Emilie Dequenne is delightful as the strangely wise and very natural Laura, and Jean-Pierre Bacri is winning as the old guy who knows better, but on reflection should thank his lucky stars

292,"	He's Our Man
 	There are so many reasons to love all things Canadian: national health insurance for all citizens, the novelist Margaret Atwood and certainly Leonard Cohen. A group of singers got together to honor Cohen by singing his songs: Nick Cave, U2 and Bono, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Anthony et al. Added to their performances are footage from many periods of Mr. Cohen's life, interviews with him and a song or two sung by him as well. We thus have this documentary that will delight Mr. Cohen's fans.  At 72, Mr. Cohen may have lost a lot of his voice-- he opines that he never could carry a tune-- but he has lost none of his brilliant self-deprecating humor.

The singers are fantastic; but why wouldn't they be with such words and lyrics?  Nick Cave sings probably Cohen's most well-known song ""Suzanne,"" introduced to the U. S. public so many years ago by Judy Collins. One wonders if the group drew straws to see who would get to sing that one. Anthony is great, of course; but the Wainwrights, both Martha (her rendition of ""The Traitor"" will put chills on your spine) and Rufus who sings ""Everybody Knows,"" ""Chelsea Hotel Number 2"" and ""Hallelujah"" are not to be missed. Rufus' account of meeting Leonard Cohen for the first time when he was feeding a young broken bird shouldn't surprise anyone who has listened to his lyrics over the years.

This film is one that those of us who love and revere this man will purchase the day it is released on DVD.

 	The reason I believe the Ring is a classic horror movie is because it disturbs me on a VERY personal, unexplainable level.  You see, the main storyline of the Ring is the fact that this video tape has been created, and anyone who watches this video tape will die in some unusual, twisted manner.  It's up to a reporter woman named Rachel to figure everything out.  She's the main character of the film, along with her son.

As I mention above, something very unusual about the film effects me in a way I can't explain.  First of all, the entire film is very effectively well-done the way everything is dark and damp and, for lack of better words, SCARY!  

The one thing I remembered after watching the Ring are some of the things that were on that video tape.  The mirror on the wall, and the location of the ladder are two things I could have SWORN I've seen somewhere before, like a childhood memory I can't figure out.  Like I've been SOMEWHERE and seen those things before.  Like the video tape used in the storyline actually existed before the film was released in 2003, and I believe I've actually SEEN the footage on that video tape many years ago *somewhere* because the sequence with the mirror and the ladder looked *incredibly* familiar.  I can't explain what it is but this is the main reason I find the movie so delightful.

 	Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.  

Paul Thomas Anderson's directing is as excessive and stylish as you'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry, with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book--long tracking shots, underwater closeups, montages, movie-within-a-movie views, and some moments that approach stream-of-consciousness (Dirk's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example).  Naturally, Anderson also loads the movie up with period details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk's room, the platform shoes, and the obligatory disco sequences.  Its visual flair aside, though, Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable, watch-it-until-you've-memorized-it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc. etc. etc.) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade.  This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it, especially its murderer's row of a cast--Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay), and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) all figure prominently--and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors.  

That said, what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like.  The main characters almost entirely have hopes, aspirations, and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession--Jack's desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dirk's ridiculous pseudo-Karate and Reed's equally ridiculous poetry; Buck's goal of opening his own stereo store; Amber's attempts to get back in touch with her son, which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co-stars--helping us see them as fleshed-out characters, not just plot devices in the story.  

Since there isn't really a plot to speak of, the movie is told as a series of episodes, Goodfellas-style, with several extended pieces--the pool party at Jack's House where Eddie/Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew; the New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of the '80's; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad's house--serving to turn the narrative in new directions.  This last set piece--when Dirk, Reed, and Todd head over to Rahad's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt--deserves special mention, as it's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory.  It starts off almost surreal, with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad (clad only in underwear, a bathrobe and slippers) discoursing semi-coherently as he sings along to not-so-classic 80's songs on a mixtape.  From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser, with the lighting, acting, and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill-conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control.  Molina's over-the-top performance, more than anything else, makes the scene, as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug-fuelled energy and, later, a shotgun-toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge.  I wouldn't say Molina turns in the best performance I've ever seen in a movie, but it it probably the best performance I've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie.

The '80's are, of course, the hangover from the joys of the previous decade, as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product, cocaine suddenly becomes addictive, and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one.  Fittingly, as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties, the movie takes a darker turn, becoming grittier, more downcast and a lot more violent, but no less compelling.  All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present, just in a decidedly less sunny form.  Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right, the movie's pedal-to-the-metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away.  Well, except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end, but by then I for one didn't care.

Based on the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who becomes a porn star as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-honored star-is-born-and-fast-blows-it-all story and an affectionate tribute to a time and place that will probably never be repeated and the people who made it what it was. Paul Thomas Anderson's direction is as excessive and stylish as you would expect from a film that revolves around the porn industry, with Anderson pulling every trick in the book - long tracking shots, underwater close-ups, montages, film-in-film views, and a few moments approaching the stream of consciousness (a prominent example is Dirk's vision of his profession literally exploding from a neon sign). Anderson also loads the film with historical details, right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenager Dirk's room, the platform shoes and the obligatory disco sequences. Apart from its visual flair, Boogie Nights is also a kind of insanely quotable, watchable film, until you remember the film that seemed to be appearing in droves in the nineties (Trainspotting, Fargo, Goodfellas, Swingers, True Romance, etc.). etc. etc.) , but in this decade supply has been worryingly scarce. This movie seems to have everything you could possibly want to make it, especially the cast of its killers - Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner), Don Cheadle (Buck Swope), John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild), Julianne Moore (Amber Waves), William H. Macy (Little Bill), Luis Guzman (Maurice Rodriguez), Tom Jane (Todd Parker), Philip Baker Hall (Floyd Gondolli), Philip Seymour Hoffman (Scotty Jay) and Alfred Molina (Rahad Jackson) are all prominent - and even Wahlberg (Dirk himself) and Heather Graham (Rollergirl) have roles that fit perfectly with their relative limitations as actors. What gives the film its resonance, however, is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters, who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like. The main characters have almost exclusively hopes, longings and ties beyond the more closed world of their profession - Jack's desire to be a serious filmmaker; Dick's ridiculous pseudo-karate and Reed's equally ridiculous poetry; Buck's goal to open his own stereo shop; Amber's attempts to reconnect with her son, which she bluntly compensates for with the motherhood of her co-stars - and help us see them as characters incarnate, not just plot devices in the story. Since there is no plot to speak of, the film is told as a Goodfellas-style episode, with several longer parts - the pool party at Jack's House, where Eddie / Dirk is introduced to the entire crew; the New Year's Eve party celebrating the beginning of the 1980s; the phony drug deal that went wrong at a Rahad's house - which serves to reset the story. This last set-piece - when Dirk, Reed and Todd drive to Rahad's home to sell him baking soda disguised as cocaine and quickly degenerates into a ridiculously misguided robbery attempt - deserves special mention, as it is one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film history. It starts almost surreal when a gaunt Chinese man accidentally lights firecrackers and half-heartedly discusses Rahad (dressed only in underwear, bathrobe and slippers) while singing along to less classic 80s songs on a mixtape. From there, it gets darker and more tense, and lighting, acting and direction serve perfectly to heighten the sense of despair and horror as Todd sets his ill-conceived robbery plot in motion and things get completely out of control."
300,"	That There Might Be Witness: Through the Eyes of Children
 	It is said that suffering develops character. Surely, when photographer Zana Briski went on a photography pilgrimage to the red light district in Sonagchi, Calcutta, in India, she discovered more character, and in smaller shape and size, then she might have imagined. Peering through a lens into the darkest shadows of life - into the world of prostitution - to capture the images the world wishes not to see, not, at least, from this angle of truth, she saw between the life-battered women... their children.  

When we think of brothels, however we might think of them, how many think of children? Whether we think of these places and their inhabitants as figures of perversity, embodiments of lust, or the tragic painted clowns of the joke that is humanity, it is probably more true than not that these women are rarely seen as, well, women. They are perhaps at best merely meat, merely body parts, to be used and abused and then tossed aside. What Zana Briski's photo lens reveals is that these are indeed women, human beings, and, for better or for worse, also mothers, daughters, wives, sisters. We see in this montage of photos and film combined, women who are deformed by the ugliness inside. They are broken, they are stunningly and fiercely angry at the world that has so betrayed them, yet they also have their moments of hope and tenderness.

All of this, and more, falls upon the heads of their children. Weaving between these women are their little ones, boys and girls who grow up around the perversities of lust and abuse. What might such children be like? This is the sharp focus of Briski's lens. 

Perhaps we need to look at ugliness to see beauty in contrast. The faces and spirits of these children contain both. They have in them the despair of those forgotten and betrayed by the world. Society all around them refuses them a place outside the red light district. They are already banned from normalcy. They have been witness to humans at their worst, and no one outside wishes to bear the weight of such witness. Yet they will not be silenced, and if we do not wish to hear them speak, then Briski has given them cameras to let them capture their worlds, inside and out, and bring these images to us. 

What these children capture on film is nothing less than breathtaking. They miss nothing. Their intense talent and power of seeing discovered, this film also shows us how Briski works to bring this artistic discovery to the world, meanwhile also fighting to give these children a chance, slim as it is, to a life of normalcy. Key to this is education, yet as she soon learns, no school in Calcutta wishes to enroll children born into brothels. At last and with determined persistence, she does find one, and a portal into life beyond opens for some of the children. Their photos, too, are put on exhibit, available also now in book format. 

Some are saved, some are pulled back into the dark. The individual stories of these tiny photographers are stories that must be witnessed, heard and seen, so that they know: everyone matters. Even in the darkest shadows, we refuse to be blind to them any longer

307,"	Dirk and Al, together again for the first time, search for a ship in the desert
 	Any movie that begins with a Civil War ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me (although my wife thought I have started playing the wrong movie). Then again, it was really upsetting at the film's climax to see the C.S.S. Texas getting shot up. Yes, I know it is just a film, but the thought of finding such a Civil War artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world, which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here. 

""Sahara"" begins at the end of the Civil War, as the Confederate ironclad Texas escapes from a burning Richmond carrying the gold supply of the Confederacy. It disappears into history, where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey), who believes the Texas crossed the Atlantic and ended up somewhere in Africa (do not ask ""how,"" because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that Dirk is right on this score). Dirk is partnered with Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes. Technically the boys work for Admiral (Ret.) Jim Sandecker (William H. Macy), who has a hard time reining them in once Dirk finds another clue about the Texas. 

Meanwhile, Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) of the World Health Organization has arrived in Africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region. However, there is another problem in that Rojas is getting too close to the truth, which puts here in danger from the local dictator, General Kazim (Lennie James), and his partner, smarmy French rich guy, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson). Dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing Eva, and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent. Al is along for the ride, as if Rudi Gunn (Rainn Wilson) for part of the way. 

These narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director Breck Eisner (""Thoughtcrimes""). The best of these is the speedboat one, involving the ""Panama,"" which comes relatively early in the film. I want to ask, ""Whatever happened to saving the best for last?"" in a film like this, but it is not like they did that in ""Raiders of the Lost Arc,"" so why should that happen here? Granted, ""Sahara"" is not as much fun as that classic film romp, but it was certainly more enjoyable than ""National Treasure,"" probably because it is not as burdened by American history and national landmarks as that one (and McConaughey and Zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality). 

Besides, I like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine, mainly because if this film is the start of a Dirk Pitt franchise, you know Al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film. I especially liked Sandecker's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth, knowing nothing about the original novels, I would much rather see the team in action than Dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film. For me the end result is that ""Sahara"" is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety. But if you want more, then look elsewhere

308,"	Ups and Downs--War  and  Remembrance miniseries from 1988
 	I did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80's.  I had seen Winds of War, however, and -- at that time, I loved it.  Now, when I purchased the DVD's, both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction.  I particularly have trouble with accepting Robert Mitchum as a virile, intelligent, sombre, alert and perceptive, about 50-something Pug Henry.  I wish some filmmaker (Curtis would be great!) would do a REMAKE of this entire project -- making it into a 4 hour feature movie -- tightening up the script entirely (apologies to Mr. Wouk who wrote the teleplay) -- mostly keep in the historical scenes--but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea-- and do away with some of the long, soap opera dialogue scenes.  Keep the Holocaust part intact --these were the MOST powerful Holocaust scenes I've EVER seen and I've seen most of them; but have someone like Kevin Costner be Pug Henry (or Harrison Ford).  And find a truly young, very vibrant Natalie (an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence), and a gorgeous, rather naive rebel leading man to play Byron (Briney).  We need to feel their chemistry -- otherwise, what transpires (Briney's desperate attempts to find Natalie and his son) seem over-wrought and contrives.I LOVED Polly Bergen as Rhoda -- it might be hard to find anyone better, I think.  And you'd need a new Hitler -- one who is more like the actor who played him in Winds of War

 	Though based on a true incident that took place in 1914, in the midst of a WWI battle among the Scots, the French and the Germans, Christian Carrion's film ""Joyeux Noel"" nonetheless has a dreamlike, other-worldly quality that says more about the state of our current international affairs than it does about Carrion's telling of this sad, sentimental tale. 
Can you imagine a contemporary world in which countries at war with each other would stop the warring long enough to drink champagne, slug vodka, play cards and toast Christ's birth? Unfortunately the Bureaucrats and Politicians react to this spur-of-the-moment camaraderie among the different factions as they usually do: they condemn the participants and accuse them of treason.
All of the actors do a fine job of creating characters who genuinely feel like they are fighting for ideals and ideas that will have a lasting effect on their lives and that of their children. They are committed. They are also of course, innocent.
The ethereal Diane Kruger plays a classical singer, a Swede and therefore neutral but married to a German soldier who, through some personal machinations as well as a pass from Kaiser Wilhelm finds herself on the battlefield on that special night of 12/24/1914. She sings Gounod's ""Ave Maria"" to a rapt audience of soldiers attending Christmas Eve Mass. It is the moral and emotional center of the film as well as its highpoint.
""Joyeux Noel"" is a nice reminder of a gentler time: a time when it was the moral and social imperative to always love your country, to always trust your leaders and to always cleave to your family. Unfortunately that time is long gone.

313,"	""Death to the fascist insect that preys on the life of the people!""
 	The documentary, ""Guerrilla--The Taking of Patty Hearst"" is a good, solid look at the bizarre story behind the Symbionese Liberation Army (the SLA)--how the SLA formed, what actions/crimes they committed, and how the group was finally apprehended. The film examines the political climate in 1970s America, and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary SLA. Political rhetoric aside, the SLA careened through California on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks. But more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the SLA, filmmaker Michael Stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment. 

Using interviews with surviving SLA members Russ Little and Michael Bortin--as well as archival news footage of the times, the documentary examines how the SLA--led by escaped criminal DeFreeze Cinque--zoomed into the headlines after the 1974 kidnapping of Patty Hearst, daughter of William Randolph Hearst. Several members of the SLA were Berkeley students--including Emily Harris--who worked in the UC Berkeley's registrar's office. With Patty Hearst as a hostage, the SLA began making demands for food distribution for poor communities, but lest one imagines that the SLA members were driven by egalitarian motives, it must be remembered that the SLA financed their lifestyle by robbing banks. During the robbing of a bank in Carmichael, customer Myna Opsahl was shot in the stomach by a shotgun blast and left there to die.

No doubt the most shocking aspect in the history of the SLA was Patty Hearst's transformation from kidnap victim to the gun-toting 'Tania' (renamed for an old girlfriend of Che Guevara) who participated in several bank robberies. The documentary includes televised pleas from Hearst's parents for Patty's safety, audiotapes from Patty announcing that she's joined the group, as well as clips of Patty's former fiance, Stephen Weed. Tim Findley--a SF Chronicle reporter who covered this bizarre case--also appears adding his insightful comments. The kidnapping of Patty Hearst and her subsequent brainwashing/conversion to the SLA remains disturbing, and certainly raises many philosophical questions. Was she just an innocent kidnapping victim, or was she young and impressionable enough to be influenced by the SLA's theories on class war? Did the fact that the Hearst family is rich and powerful have any bearing on their daughter's Presidential pardon? Well watch the documentary and decide for yourself. 

There's so much to be learned from watching a documentary that explores in depth an old news item that still remains locked in the archives of one's memory. DVD extras include comments by the director Michael Stone, the audiotapes by Patty Hearst, footage of the Hibernia bank robbery, and segments of court hearings between SLA members and the son of murder victim Myna Opsahl. These speeches from the former SLA members--as they try to explain and justify the murder of Opsahl--serve as a reminder of the irrevocable damage caused by taking a life--displacedhuma

But more than just an investigation of the events surrounding the SLA, filmmaker Michael Stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment. Using interviews with surviving SLA members Russ Little and Michael Bortin, as well as archive footage from the time, the documentary examines how the SLA - led by escaped criminal DeFreeze Cinque - hit the headlines after the abduction of Patty Hearst, daughter of William Randolph Hearst, in 1974. Several members of the SLA were Berkeley students - including Emily Harris - who worked in the registry office at the University of Berkeley. With Patty Hearst hostage, the SLA began to make demands for food distribution to poor communities, but lest one believe that the SLA members were driven by egalitarian motives, it is worth remembering that the SLA financed its lifestyle through bank robbery. Customer Myna Opsahl was shot in the stomach and died in the robbery of a bank in Carmichael. Undoubtedly the most shocking aspect of the SLA's history was Patty Hearst's transformation from kidnapping victim to weapon-staring ""Tania"" (renamed after an old friend of Che Guevara's), who was involved in several bank robberies. The documentary includes televised appeals from Hearst's parents for Patty's safety, tapes of Patty announcing she had joined the group, and clips of Patty's former fiancÃ© Stephen Weed. Tim Findley - a reporter for the SF Chronicle who covered the bizarre case - also appears to add his revealing comments. The abduction of Patty Hearst and her subsequent brainwashing / conversion to the SLA remains disturbing and certainly raises many philosophical questions. Was she just an innocent kidnapping victim, or was she young and impressive enough to be influenced by the SLA's theories about class struggle? Did the fact that the Hearst family is rich and powerful have any influence on the president's pardon of their daughter? Well, look at the documentation and make your own decision."
314,"	Cliffhanger
 	Certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they don't make movies like this anymore! From the instant when the dazzling 3-D artdeco credits appear, we're onboard for the ride of our lives, actually the lives of hero Cary Grant (1904-86) and Eva Marie Saint. The plot of this 100 percent attention-keeper thickens as its characters sicken. Notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble James Mason (remember him? 1909-84) and ever-dapper Leo G. Carroll (who later played the ghost in the TV series Topper). Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant-tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore, which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting, here becoming a backdrop of life-and-death drama. Of the 50-some films of Sir Hitchcock (1899-1980) I'd rate this in the top three, with Psycho and Rebecca rounding out the bases.

 	As I have found with most Baby Einstein movies, this one engages my very active 10-month-old baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy. While I know that watching tv too much is unhealthy, she will not even give regular television a second gland (which I'm glad about). However, there are times when I need her to be more calm like when I change a diaper, try feeding new foods, and right before and after naps. These movies have been lifesavers to me. 

This one in particular is nice because it is introducing the body by identifying the same parts on babies and animals. I love to give her a bath and do the ""head and shoulders, knees and toes"" song with her and point to the different parts. She also loves to stand in front of a mirror and we'll point out our eyes, mouths, etc. This movie is a great introduction for babies and toddlers to understand their body parts.

319,"	""The loss of civil rights may be imposed.""
 	The film's title ""Paragraph 175"" refers to the passage in German law forbidding homosexuality. Paragraph 175 was first introduced into law in 1871, and as a result, homosexuals were subject to criminal prosecution and blackmail. Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, a German Jewish doctor, and a pioneer in the study of Human Sexuality, formed the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee with the goal of repealing Paragraph 175. In Weimar Germany of the 1920s, an enhanced feeling of social and sexual freedom augured well for homosexuals, and Berlin became a ""homosexual Eden."" But once the Nazis took power, they enforced anti-gays laws with a vengeance. According to historian Klaus Muller, in Nazi Germany 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality, and approximately 10,000-15,000 were sent to concentration camps. Of that number, less than 10 remained alive at the time the film was made. The film, gently and non-intrusively narrated by Rupert Everett, is built around interviews with a handful of homosexuals who survived the concentration camps. 

Once the Nazis took power, they moved swiftly and systematically against the homosexual community. Survivors detail how they clung to vain hope--one man, for example believed that with known homosexual, Ernst Rohm controlling the Sturmabteilung (SA) other homosexuals would be safe. Another survivor noted the homosexual clubs remained open after the Nazis came to power, and he took this as a positive sign before he realized that ""they let us keep our meeting places, so we could be snatched up."" 

The survivors tell their painful stories. One man looks through a photo album in which most of the photos have now been removed; another looks at a photo of a large family gathering and is able to pick out the faces of the two relatives who survived. One remembers the screams of those hung from poles. One man spent years in Buchenwald--only to be snatched up and thrown in Dachau. While most of the survivors are unable or unwilling to describe their experiences in the concentration camps, the grief, the anger, and the outrage are just below the surface. 

""Paragraph 175"" is an important, gripping, powerful film--those incarcerated, tortured and murdered for their sexual orientation should not be forgotten. The anti-homosexual movement began as a loss of Civil Rights and devolved into one of the most shameful episodes in history. To quote one of the survivors, ""I am ashamed for humanity""--displacedhuma

320,"	Good DVD, great matches...
 	Ah, Chris Benoit, one of my all-time favorites, which is why I was thrilled when I bought this DVD almost 2 years ago. Personally, I think the documentary is good and somewhat in-depth, I just would've liked it to be longer. But it starts with Benoit's early years growing up in Canada, then to Japan, then ECW, WCW and finally WWE. 

   Benoit's comments make this doc. pretty good, despite the short running time (about 75 mins.), but the matches are where this DVD really shines. 
   
   There are 15 matches in total and footage from WCW, ECW and Japan against opponents like Jushin Thunder Liger, Black Tiger (Eddie Guerrero) and Great Sasuke, which was footage I loved seeing as it was quite rare.

   This is a great DVD purchase don't get me wrong, my only problem is as I said the documentary, it's very good, I love watching it, I just wanted it to be longer.

321,"	Amazing
 	This DVD provides Benoit's life story, which I found very interesting. I believe they could have chosen a slightly better match selection, but it was still pretty great.

Pegasus Kid VS Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger- This is the type of wrestling I love. Plenty of chain wrestling, huge Japanese crowd meaning a very quiet yet applaud filled match. This match is where Chris Benoit became a huge star in Japan. Benoit puts on a great match with a Japanese legend. 8.5/10

Wild Pegasus VS The Great Sasuke- This was another match with plenty of chains, and some pretty cool high flying stuff by both guys, but mainly Sasuke. Like the Liger match, this was a fast-paced and solid 20 minute match. 8.5/10

Wild Pegasus VS Black Tiger[Eddie Guerrero]- These two have had some far better matches, and this is one of those that I wished would have been replaced by something a little better. Still a solid match. 7/10

Chris Benoit VS Too Cold Scorpio[ECW]- These two have some nice chemistry together. Another 20 minute match ending just before the bell. 8/10

Chris Benoit VS Al Snow[ECW]- Many consider this to be a great match, but I just couldn't get into it. Slow-paced match until towards end. 6.5/10

Chris Benoit VS Kevin Sullivan[WCW Nitro]- This was an all out brawl, going all over the arena, including the bathrooms. Very impressive finish. 8/10

Chris Benoit VS Eddie Guerrero[WCW Nitro]- A very solid match with these two. Great chemistry together, Eddie and benoit show abilitiese we have not seen for awhile. 7.5/10

Chris Benoit VS Bret Hart[WCW Owen Hart Tribute Match]- This was a phenominal match. Bret is a true great, as is Benoit. You just don't see this sort of stuff nowadays. 9.5/10

Chris Benoit VS William Regal[Brian Pillman Tribute Show]-Weird lighting for this match, and not very active crowd. Besides that, Benoit and Regal put on a classic. 8/10

Chris Benoit VS Kurt Angle[RAW Steel Cage Match]-This match was amazing. Benoit and Angle are the finest chain wrestler in WWE today, and they put on a classic steel cage match. Stone Cold Steve Austin does guest commentary. 9/10

Chris Benoit VS Kurt Angle[Royal Rumble 2003 WWE Title Match]- Benoit and Angle put on another classic in the main-event of the Royal Rumble. Just a truly fantasic match with plenty of false finished, submissions and high-impact moves. 10/10

Chris Benoit VS Shawn Michaels VS Triple H[Wrestlemania XX World Title Match]- This is my all time favorite match. The main-event for Wrestlemania XX is often called the best Wrestlemania main-event ever, and it isn't surprising. A long, bloody match with pedigrees, sweet chin musics, sharpshooters, crossfaces, diving headbutts, and breaking tables. 10/10

322,"	Where the line between humans and machines is blurred
 	I'll admit to you that I love to watch Adult Swim, and I'll also admit that I like certain types of anime. No, I'm not one of those nerdy card-trading Poke'mon lovers, I'm a young adult who likes to use my imagination in my down time. I like anime that's made for adults like: Big O!, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Outlaw Star, Tenchi and Ghost in the shell. 

I was watching either watching Family Guy or Aqua Teen Hunger Force when I saw previews for this show start to air on Adult Swim, I thought thought it looked cool, it featured what looked to me like a cool futuristic take on robots and the humans that are seamlessly integrated with cybornetics to make them almost immortal, But I didn't know the half of it. 

What I got was a cyber-punk version of the old black-and-white film noir mysteries. The series receives its subtitle from a theoretical mental complex attributed to the adaptation of cybernetics into the mass public. In the story, 'stand alone complex' is said to describe copies with no original and is portrayed by copycat crimes with no original criminal, or in other words, an imaginary criminal. It also refers to the structure of each episode: Each episode can be viewed independently of each other, and there is little catch-up (if at all) given in each episode to keep the viewer up to date. 

Taking place in a fictional city of Japan called ""Niihama-shi"" (New Port City) in the year 2030, Stand Alone Complex tells the story of a special operations task-force called Public Security Section 9, or simply ""Section 9"". The series follows the exploits of Section 9's agents who range from ex-military to ex-police as they address each case and how it affects them on a personal level, eventually leading to the mysterious figure dubbed by the media as ""The Laughing Man"". 

Public Security Section 9 is an elite domestic anti-crime unit tasked with the charge of preemptive prevention of technology-related acts of terrorism and crime. Their duties include response to serious cyber crimes (i.e. Cyberbrain hacking, cyber-terrorism), investigation of unlawful acts of those in public office and of high profile murder cases. From time-to-time they also serve as protection to foreign VIPs. 

If you have seen the movie then you know that the TV series differs from the cinema adaptation in its focus upon issues created by the advance of technology. Instead of the intensely focused and personal examination of technology, presented is a look at society and technology as a larger whole. The series of 26 half-hour TV episodes has a larger budget of time to explore the concepts and ideas found in the original manga. In comparison to the film version, the series is considered by many to be easier to understand. Also, in comparison, the series can be found to be closer to the manga; due to the presence of some humor, the usage of the Tachikomas (Fuchikomas in the manga, and referred to simply as ""tanks"" in the one scene a derivant version makes an appearance in), the design of the characters, and also, the usage of the characters Paz, Bouma and Saito. Stand Alone Complex exhibits the accumulated experience and expertise of Production I.G. in their application of computer generated imagery. This is evident in their digital color grading, environmental effects, and cell-shaded computer models. Their work has been highly praised for its subtle contribution to a scene, which adds greatly to the atmosphere. 

I think a lot of people will try to compare this to Cowboy Bebop as with so many other anime and mangas, but that's foolish. Stand Alone Complex is no better or worse than Cowboy Bebop, it's just a different story, different style, different sets of charactors and there places. 

if you like anime or manga you'll definitely like this show. It's complex, has views on modern terrorism and how to deal with it, and not to mention the technology! Even if you don't watch anime just give a chance and take it for what it is.

Fonda appeared in many movies with Ford as well, including ""Drums Along The Mohawk,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" and another immortal Western, ""My Darling Clementine.""

329,"	Scathing Hollywood satire
 	This is a wonderful inside-Hollywood thriller/comedy directed by Robert Altman. Tim Robbins stars as a big shot producer who begins receiving hate mail from one of his rejected writers. He thinks he's figured out who it is (Vincent D'Onofrio), goes to meet him, and in a rage kills him. He then falls in love with D'Onofrio's weird girlfriend (Gretta Scacchi), an artist who can't ever finish anything. There is also a movie within the movie which has to do with the making of a melodrama in which an innocent woman is about to be executed - only to be rescued at the last minute by the D.A. Altman's theme has to do with  the Hollywood version of reality, which is nothing more than what will earn big bucks; it has nothing to do with ""truth."" A long list of Hollywood stars make cameo appearances. It's really a well-done movie, very classy and hip. Altman also satirizes Hollywood power players extremely well - it's a whole other world out there in LaLa land

330,"	Absolutely ""Stellar""
 	I've actually been hoping for a live CD release, but I was more than happy with this DVD. All the favorites are here (only a minor gripe with the omission of Echo and 11am, and the inclusion of Priceless, but that's just personal preference). This is all the evidence needed to show that this band has reached maturity. Drive is an unexpected change, but being the most played-out song in their lineup, the obscurity is welcome. The musical talent all around seems much improved from the previous DVDs, and each member gets to show off all their new tricks. Unlike some other bands, Incubus seems to perfectly display each musician's talents so well with each song, and this -for me- showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly. Every song is a highlight on this one - my favorites are Made for TV Movie and Sick Sad Little World.
Other notes: It's the perfect place to film for a DVD; We get to see Brandon play guitar and how well Ben works as a backup singer; and I think Jose could make any rock band sound good. Recommended for any fan of Incubus, especially of their newer material

 	When I first found the Broadway Lost Treasure Serier on Amazon, I nearly jumped up and down in my seat. Any Broadway clips that I can get a hold of I definitly must get. I bought Broadway Lost Treasure I and Broadway Lost Treasures II together. I must say the performances were very good, just because you can't call broadway bad. The way the performances were put together, however, was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes. Dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic(Jerry Orbach,Angela Lansbery.etc)some of my favorite people, but I wanted I little bit more background information on the shows and things like that.

Overall, I encourage purchasing Broadway Lost Treasures II(and the first one),if you keep an open mind. If you dont know alot about broadway, then this will bore you to tears. This is not what you should purchase if you want to learn more about broadway. If you are more interested in learning more about broadway, rather than just seeing performances, then I would buy ""Broadway: The American Musical"" (which can be found on Amazon).

332,"	An absolutely wonderful film.  I loved it !!!!!!!
 	I bought this as a dvd for home use.  I won't repeat the story as others have done so already.  I loved the story.  The plot was well put together and solid.  The acting was wonderful.  I have watched it a couple of times now and enjoy it more each time I see it. I really am enjoying the fun of this film.  I'd suggest to folks to just relax and watch a terrific and humorous film.  It is made to be light with family values of what counts in life.    Tim did an outstanding job as he always does. The chasing scenes with Tim on all fours becoming a dog; the dog behaviors as a human had me rolling. It is one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time.  As an adult I loved it and would buy it again. I'm thrilled to see Disney making such terrific and wonderful films.  It was tastefully done.  The caged scenes were carefully done.  No bad language just a wonderful film that can be enjoyed as another eventual classic among the Disney films.  And no I didn't perceive this as a film geared toward small children.  Perhaps pre-teens and up would be my guess.  To demean the film based on the expectation that tiny children would appreciate the story is not realistic nor does it do justice for what the film is.  It is a wonderful film with a great storyline!!  corinn

333,"	EPIC: Amazingly real and terrifically told...
 	Das Boot is an epic film that is very well done. I loved the suspense and terrific character moments. The thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a Nazi U-boat in the midst of the Atlantic during 1941 WWII. Going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean. The three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film.

This movie is now one of the top ten movies of all time for me.

In viewing the DVD, I chose to turn on English Subtitles while also selecting the English 2.0 spoken language. What is interesting is how the english dub has paraphrased certain lines and in others totally changed every meaning behind the statements. I'm talking about the line that, in German, reads something like ""I can't wait to get back home and f**k the h*ll out of a few wild wh**es!"" is rewritten and dubbed as ""When I get home I'm going to shower and sleep until December!"" Quite a drastic change. But of course, sailors in the German Navy use language that I suppose is unacceptable - even in an ""R"" rated movie - for English audiences... 

There are more than fifteen conversations of that nature that have been translated into English subtitles from the German language spoken in the original dub of the film, while the English dub is totally different. Later in the film, there are even lines shown in subtitles that are not spoken at all in the English dub. Very interesting and fun to watch.

Even with the subtitles on, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I love the epic movies that run well over two and a half hours. This one clocks in at a good four and a half hours! It draws you in and keeps you going from the very first moment to the very last explosion... 

One of the best war movies I have ever seen!

One of the most interesting ironies of this film is that the entire movie takes place within the Nazi U-boat and we get to see and feel compassion for the German men who fight to keep the boat afloat. The irony occurs when the Allied forces attack them and we get to experience the other side of the equation. Very intense and dramatic

 	His words to the jury, a petition for strength for them against great odds, for himself against greater odds, for a system sometimes blind to justice, and for the victim of negligence who has no voice, puts a lump in your throat today 25 years after the release of 'The Verdict.'

TV bytes and news reports of lawyers' greed today have surpassed the image of scoundrels as nearly all of us now just leave them to their money-grubbing best. And the courage and brilliance of ""Brown v. Board"" and ""Heart of Atlanta"" exemplifying courageous men and women doing what is best fade into a distant past. But once in while a movie ('Mockingbird') comes along and moves powerfully to recall what it was that attracted us to the beauty of this ancient profession: to do what is right, or even better, to do what is right against great odds.

Frank Galvin, drunk, ambulance chaser, liar, failure, had that dream once but a mistake, an error of judgemnt, a naive trust in loyalty that was gravely misplaced led him to where he is now, sucking on breath mints and bourbon, handing out cards, working for booze money.

His old friend Jack Warden handed him a case, a no-brainer, a lovely Irish girl who went into labor and came out brain dead. The Defendants? A squeaky clean, Chaired, lauded, published and handsome OBGYN and  . . . . the Diocese of Boston. And Frank's going to cave. Hell. It's the eve of trial and he's been drunk through the 24 months of discovery. And then he prepares for the Settlement Conference with the Dfense Lawyer, James Mason (just positively brilliant) and goes to the girls hospital room where she is machine fed and takes photos. But a funny thing happens. Lke Marcellus (Burton) winning the Robe in the lottery at the foot of the cross or a drunk at his first AA meeting, Frank's not sure but something's different. And he begins to wonder if maybe this time he won't cave.

Great, morbid, wry, ironic, gallows humor. Warden says after the Settlement Conference, ""whadja' think of (Mason)?"" Galvin: He's good. Warden: Good? He's the  [. . . . .] Prince of Darkness. 

A cast that you have heard of and seen a thousand times and some that you would never see again all working together to bring you a blue collar story of the good thief. I don't know that there is a better trial movie.

episode nine: beatbox bandits- this episode, though not very good, still has some funny scenes and some action. mugen jin and fuu are caught trying to pass through a checkpoint with counterfiet passes. the checkpoint officials find out that they did not make the forgeries, and cut a deal. mugen is sent to do one of their croked errands. will mugen stay true to his companions? watch and find out.
i rate this episode a 5/10, simply because it lacked action and plot, plus the man telling the story is looking back thirty years to when the episode occured. i don't know, maybe it's the thought of jin mugen and fuu being old, but i don't dig the old man looking that far back.

episode ten: lethal lunacy- one of my favorite, if not my all time favorite, SC episodes! this episode kicks anus in every way possible! i dont want to reveal to much of the story line, but i reccomend watching this episode! even if this dvd just had this episode and was still full price, i would still buy it!
i rate this episode a -/-, or infinite. if you really want stars, it is 10/10, though i find that underappreciating the episode to give it a finite rating

episode eleven: gamblers and gallentry- jin falls in love with a depressed woman who has been forced to work in a whore-house to pay off her husbands debt. still a good episode, but not the best. lots of great humor.
i rate this episode 7/10.

episode twelve: the disorder diaries- recap episode. jin and mugen read fuu's diary while she takes a bath. this episode has a lot of funny dialogue, but that's the only thing it has working for it.
i rate this episode 3/10

 	Two years later, the Red Sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in September thinking it never happened.  It was a utopian dream, the comfort of the drugged and sleeping.

But it *did* happen. It's here on film.  They couldn't have made this all up and - besides - I remember it. Like it was yesterday.

The producers of this DVD didn't have much of a World Series series to work with. The Sox swept the Cardinals in four.  

The real drama was the American League Championship Series.

Still, the producers have done a remarkable job of building the context of the Curse of the Bambino, the tragedy snatched from the jaws of triumph in years that are branded into the thighs and brains of Red Sox fans - 1967, 1975, 1986 - the new Spring hopes that make one feel a little foolish. The mind games. The despair. The self-loathing.

It all ended in 2004. 

It's right here on film.

The names now fit comfortably beside those of Yaz and the rest of Fenway's venerable ghosts: Schilling, Damon (still beloved in pinstripes), Pedro, Millar, Derek Lowe, Trot, Big Papi, Manny Being Manny, 'Skip' Francona, the undyingly heroic field captain 'Tek' Varitek, the man paid to steal one base (Dave Roberts). The gutsy trade of Nomar.

Then there were the demons of this passion play: All the Yankees, but particularly A-Rod, who played the part of a bizarrely emasculated Lucifer. And all the Yankees, again. And again.

Everybody else was just there that season for bit parts and background noise for Big Papi's walkoff homers and Curt Schillings epochal bloody sock, the crux of Red Sox Nation's unlikely redemption.

A Red Sox fan watching this DVD for the fifth time can still not suppress the goosebumps. 

Where were we for this game? And that game? The true fans among us are slightly embarrassed about the fact that we remember where, a stroke of intellectual capacity that is supposed to be reserved for truly international events.

As I write this in mid-October, 2006, the Sox are at home and Detroit is facing off with Oakland for the American League Championship.

It doesn't matter.  We won. It's right there on the DVD.  Plus, the soundtrack is brilliant.

It all ends in glory after all, not ashes.  Redemption

The mind games. Despair. The self-deprecation. It all ended in 2004. That's right here in the movie. The names now fit comfortably with those of Yaz and Fenway's other venerable spirits: Schilling, Damon (still popular in pinstripes), Pedro, Millar, Derek Lowe, Trott, Big Papi, Manny Being Manny, ""Skip"" Francona, the immortally heroic Field Captain ""Tek"" Varitek, the man paid to steal a base (Dave Roberts)."

347,"	Still my favorite anime after all this time
 	This anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network, and now is definetly considered a classic alongside Cowboy Bebop and others. This is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people. Yoko Kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect. It's so beautiful and fits the story so well. The overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful. 

As for the languages and region, while I wouldn't know yet for this particular box set, I would assume it is just like the individual DVDs they put out with Japanese and English language and English subtitles. And I don't know where to look for the region of the DVD, but I think it might be region 1, whatever it means. I do know that I haven't had any troubles playing it on any of our DVD players.

348,"	Excellent but I would have wanted more realism
 	This is a very emotional film.  It induces emotion in the viewer, and for that I give it five stars.  I'm more interested in constructive criticism than in praise, so even though I think it is an excellent film, I will just focus on what I think is wrong with it.

One problem is that Blanche DuBois is simply too pretty for the role.  We don't understand, on a gut level, why this beautiful girl would worry about hiding behind dim lighting.  The script makes it clear that she is supposed to look ""old"", and yet she doesn't.  That's a fault of the film.  It makes her final passionate scene with Karl Malden incomprehensible.  He holds her up to the light, she looks very pretty, and yet we are supposed to believe that she looks terrible in bright light.  For that I blame the director, Elia Kazan.  What in God's name could he have been thinking of, and why did he mess up so badly on that important detail?

Another important fault of this film is that Stanley Kowalski's attack on Blanche isn't set up properly.  Are we just supposed to believe that he is an animal, and chalk it up to that?  Sorry, not good enough.  We should have seen it coming.  Again, another big mess-up by Kazan.  When the script has the characters doing something that doesn't ring true, there's a problem.  We needed to see that attack being led up to.  We needed to think ""Oh my god, I know what he is about to do.""

Stanley Kowalski is actually the good guy throughout most of the movie.  All of a sudden it turns.  It's incomprehensible.  Somewhere between the writing, directing, and acting, somebody dropped the ball somewhere.  The Stanley Kowalski who attacks Blanche is not the same man who appears earlier in the film.  He's not an ""animal"".  He's not set up that way for us. Blanche is the snob, and Stanley is okay, but that is turned on its head at the end.

Insanity is a nice little copout.  We can make our actors do anything, and just say okay, they went nuts.  Very touching, but not very realistic.  How does someone go insane?  What stages do they go through?  Blanche's descent into insanity, into an inability to tell reality from fantasy, should have been more realistic, more researched, more consistent with the way it actually happens.  It does happen to people, people who are extremely bipolar, people who are schizophrenic.  More research should have been done, to show what the descent into insanity actually does look like.

I have high standards, but that's a good thing, I think.  Still, I've given this film five stars

349,"	Moving and influential
 	I first saw this movie in high school in the theater.  I was extremely moved by the film, and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day - I even work half the year in Sri Lanka now.  So for me, personally, this movie is of tremendous influence.

I understand the arguements about the crediting of non-white actors; I always wondered why Candice Bergman is given top billing, given that she only appears in a very few scenes.  Well, that's the way of the world - it's marketing right or wrong, and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known.  It's not right, but that's Hollywood. I mean, better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all, yes?

And you've got to admit, it was quite a debut for Ben Kingsly. Wow.  He'll be forever known for this role.

That aside, this is an excellent, amazing film.  Of course, it's still highly relevant, perhaps even more so in our post-911 world of fear.  

The movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration.  A must-see for anyone who feels anger, fear, agressively nationalistic, hopelessness, hatred, or lost.  I can think of several politicans who need to see this movie

 	There have been emblematic films that plainly, justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment. But few times, we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness, constancy and dedication like this one. 

We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions  

On the other hand of the coin, (and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts) she displayed by far,  the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year.

One more thing: in order to the fairness, I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance: Ellen Burstyn and ""Requiem for a dream"". And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967, where the difference in what acting concerns was even major.

 	On the face of it, a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi-romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as ""niche"" as you can get, but don't overlook this film. The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you'll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a ""coming of age"" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours

He is caretaker to his friends in life and in death, and the central character that the six others revolve around; it is befitting that he will be the last to go.

362,"	Something is rotten in the state of Tokyo...
 	""The Bad Sleep Well"" is a forgotten gem from one of Japan's great masters, Akira Kurosawa. His other two Shakespeare adaptations, ""Throne of Blood"" (Macbeth) and ""Ran"" (King Lear), are much more famous and well-regarded, justifiably so if you have seen them (""Ran"" is particular is my favorite of all Kurosawa films). However, this sharp and caustic adaptation of Hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition. It may be the most bleak subject matter that Kurosawa ever tackled - the corruption in the highest levels of government in post-war Japan.

The film begins with a long but funny wedding sequence that illustrates Kurosawa's great skill as a director. We (and the camera) are among a group of reporters discussing the numerous convenient reasons for the marriage; the bride is lame and the daughter of Iwabuchi, the head of corporation,  and the bridegroom, Nishi, has aspirations to elevate his status in the business. We see the comedy of manners play out in this sequence in increasingly humorous situations as the various parties deny these rumours and reporters comment to each other, culminating in the panicked looks on the faces of the corporate higher-ups as the wedding cake arrives - in the shape of their office building, Public Corp., with a red X marking a spot in one of the windows where one of their former partners commited suicide. It's a virtuoso sequence that perfectly sets up the tone of the rest of the film.

The newspapers have a field day with this, especially when various members of Public Corp. are investigated for fraud and embezzlement, yet they stoically remain silent and the case goes nowhere. Then it heats up again as a few of them commit suicide; the rumours are that they were goaded into doing so (n fact, they were). However, without any substance to press the matter, the case is dropped. And that's when the real story begins - one of the Public Corp executives, Wada, survives and is rescued by Nishi and his shadowy accomplice, Itakura.

This is followed by a brilliant scene in which Wada is taken to his own funeral and observes the farce - all the while, Nishi plays him a tape with Moriyama and Shirai, his former partners, plotting his murder. The way Kurosawa stages this is masterful; the sublime music emanating from the funeral is contrast dramatically with the cold-blooded words of Public Corp, as Wada listens on. One of the ways Wada contributes is to scare the living hell out of Shirai - Wada poses as a ghost of himself in order to freak out Shirai (a pointed but clever method of tying in the ghost in Hamlet). As the plot progresses, Nishi reveals his reasons for saving Wada and exacting a very personal revenge on Iwabuchi and his cohorts; the story's pace becomes more frantic and exciting.

Technically, Kurosawa is at his best here. The wedding and the funeral are both marvels and they contrast each other perfectly. He uses a lot of intriguing mise-en-scene compostions for his interiors that serve to highlight his characters' inner thoughts but very little movement of the camera in order to manipulate his audience; the dark nature of the story is enough to suck you in. One of the fascinating observations in ""The Bad Sleep Well"" is that all of the characters are morally bankrupt and filled with secrets - even Nishi, the protagonist. His wife, the Ophelia character, is the only one that Kurosawa allows us to feel sympathy for, and even then in the end she is not fully spared her grief. Taken in this context, Kurosawa's Hamlet becomes a study in the morality and pragmatism of revenge but also an incisive jab at the fat cats in modern Japan.

If there is a flaw in the film, it is that the overall pacing is not always brisk enough to sustain the long running time (2 1/2 hours). The wedding, despite being absolutely essential, is protracted; the rest of the film is much quicker but still drags in parts. Also, Kurosawa seems unsure about his ending; the film ends quite abruptly but appropriately in terms of his larger point about the hopelesness of fighting the rampant corruption, I would argue. However, despite these flaws, overall ""The Bad Sleep Well"" is a masterful and dark excursion into the seedy side of corporate crime, using Shakespeare Hamlet brilliantly but not completely as it's core. Toshiro Mifune in particular gives one of his most unique low-key performances; instead of his usual fiery exterior we get a performance full of internalized anger throughout. Highly reccomended

 	Murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle. Which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a ""regular Don Juan"" to his neighbor Winston, a family man.
Murrey gets talked into visiting 4 women whom he knew 20 years ago, searching for a possible son, whose existence is unclear, and who may just be a hoax. 
The visits are all shocking in different ways. All women live in similar locations, though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth. All encounters are odd, the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident. She was number 5 in the list of ""suspects"" for the mother of the phantom son.
Don't watch this film if you need action or a plot. If you are happy with smart dialogues, odd situations, great acting, a script worked to perfection, this is one for you

370,"	Reading the Compass
 	""The Medium"" instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005.  I usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal, which tuned me in.  However, it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating.  Patricia Arquette who was in ""Ed Wood"" with Johnny Depp plays Alison DuBois.  Her Emmy win for Best Actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry, but the on-screen chemistry with Jake Weber who was in ""Meet Joe Black"" and plays her husband Joe is riveting.  They fight, spat, try to mask conflict in front of their kids, juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks, and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of Alison's psychic ability.  I found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show, I still wanted to watch them over episodes of CSI Miami that I had not seen.   When I bought the DVD, I was hoping there might have been an episode I'd missed, but I'd seen them all between NBC  and  Lifetime reruns several times.  I'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing.  Alison's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together.  What impresses me about Alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing.  In a world of violence, it's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points.  In the episode ""In Sickness  and  Adultery"" her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her.  As she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife, she finds that her best defense is the truth.  The two older daughters are also jewels.  Maria Lark as Bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream, ""Mom, please stop doing that!""  Sofia Vassilieva as the older Aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing.  David Cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of Detective Lee Scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with Arquette.  Miguel Sandoval as the district attorney Manuel Duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show.  (Perhaps we will sometime see more about his family.)  While it's hard to pick my favorite first season episode, the complex plot of ""A Priest, A Doctor  and  Medium Walk into an Execution Chamber"" is a jewel, with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder.  The DVD commentaries and introduction to the real-life Alison DuBois really give excellent background for fans of the show.  This is one show that reaches the level of art for me.  Its excellence will make it memorable for a long time  and  this DVD collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection.  Bravo

373,"	Without a doubt, the definitive version of Blade Runner.
 	While I've always loved Blade Runner, the so-called ""Theatrical Cut"" was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation.  Harrison Ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped.  But Hollywood, in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience's intelligence and artistic sensitivity, stuck with it anyway, on the assumption that we needed to be spoon-fed with sophomoric incompetence.

Equally stupid, though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted, was the inappropriate sappy ending, which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well.  It didn't even make any sense: the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars.  But Hollywood, with characteristic cowardice, trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience.  Rick Deckard's fate at the end of the Director's Cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982, and the subsequent VHS audience.  It reminds me of what Orion Pictures did to George Romero's Monkeyshines. (Since when does a Romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots?)  Or how about the ""happy ending"" grotesquely grafted onto Terry Gilliam's Brazil?

The extra footage between Deckard and Rachael, while not extensive, enriches the characterizations, however modestly, and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end.  The only thing I regret is that the extra bloody footage - in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes - found on the old VHS tape was not included in the Director's Cut.  Which means that this is not fully the Director's Cut: the material was left out to garner the sacred, almighty ""R"" rating upon the film's re-release, as it was the first time around.  One would think it would have been restored on DVD, but Warner, with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude, decided against it.  They probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that Ridley Scott would have wanted it that way.  Can anyone say ""Eyes Wide Shut""?

The fact that there are viewers course enough to value the ""theatrical cut"" and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that Hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all.   And ""definitive"" the Director's Cut is: despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage, there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again, by anyone.

378,"	A surprisingly okay documentary
 	I just finished watching most of it, and it's not too bad. The thing that most struck me is it doesn't take very long to see which were the eras for Superman that had the most influence on Bryan Singer. He spent quite a bit of time explaining how hard it was for them to get Superman started, then we're quickly through the comics and the Kirk Alyn eras, then it slows down for a long retrospective of the George Reeves years, both in Superman and the Mole Men and The Adventures of Superman, then it blows through again through the comics and the animated series of the 50s, 60s and 70s, then stops again for a lengthy study of Superman: the Movie, then briefly about Superman II, Superman III, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and Superboy, then briefly on Lois  and  Clark: The New Adventures of Superman and Superman: The Animated Series, and then we slow down again for a lengthy study of Smallville, and then it becomes a big commercial for Superman Returns. 

Or at least that's how I perceived it. Singer's got great respect for George Reeves, Superman: The Movie (and Christopher Reeve), and Smallville ... and that's pretty much it. Most anything else, he quickly blew through as if it were completely non-consequential. Well, except for his own movie, but I expected that part; produced by Bryan Singer and narrated by Kevin Spacey, you'd have to be pretty stupid not to realize that at least a chunk of it would be dedicated to selling the new movie. I had to turn it off at that point. Not that I disliked Superman Returns, but as soon as Kevin Spacey said how the actors in Superman Returns were ""perfect"" for their roles and then began discussing way-too-young Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane, I started getting nausiated. 

I will give credit, they were remarkably honest with their assessments of the various projects. I loved it when Annette O'Toole, a self-avowed fan of the character who played Lana Lang in Superman III and Martha Kent on Smallville, expresses shock that there was actually a Superman IV (""There was a Superman IV!? I never saw that one!"" - she didn't miss much); I thought it was refreshing that though they never got nasty about stuff, if a movie was a disappointment or a comic storyline flopped, they pretty much admitted it. And I liked that Ilya Salkind was willing to take some of the blame for the bad blood that happened behind the scenes of Superman: The Movie and Superman II; it reflected well on him that he didn't just blame Richard Donner, as he might have been apt to do while they were doing their fighting back in the day. 

But I do think it needed more balance. We didn't need to spend quite so much time watching clips of George Reeves or of seeing Christopher Reeve with his sweat stains; those moments and the stuff from Smallville could have been trimmed down nicely to give more time to other elements, perhaps more of The Animated Series/Justice League Unlimited era or to Lois and Clark. There were also some moments where they went back to talking about the comics, even though it was periods where nothing significant was happening in the comics; as if someone said, hey, we haven't acknoweledged that the comics are still in production at this point, we should say something. Thus too making the whole thing feel dry and unbalanced. 

BTW, I recognized a comic from my own personal collection! There's a three-panel shot at one moment where the ground is scorched into the ""S"" symbol, then a hand comes up out of the dirt and then Clark appears and walks off. I have that comic -- it's an alternate storyline issue, the first time they kill off Superman and in the same issue, Superman and Lois wed (and this was all long before Doomsday). It's actually a very cool story.

 	""Office Space"" is a very funny comedy. Many parts of the film were a delight. In the beginning, when everyone is stalled in traffic, I knew the feeling. Working at Initech Corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston). Besides having a job he hates, he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is. Then there is his boss Lumbergh--an arrogant jerk. Life for Peter Gibbons is just one boring day after another. That is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion [and demands] of his then girlfriend.

While undergoing hypnotic suggestion, the psychologist dies of a heart-attack. But Peter is now a changed man. He no longer cares about his job, and says whatever's on his mind. And his boss Lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new Peter. When Peter learns of the impending layoff [courtesy of John C. McGinley and his partner] at Initech Corporation, he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus.  His two fellow co-workers and friends are only too happy to go along: afterall, they're part of the layoff's. And on top of that, the company men want to make Peter a supervisor. 

This film is funny on many levels. With Jennifer Anniston as the love interest of Peter, and the character actors that make up the film--it makes for an enjoyable watch. Jennifer Anniston's character and her dealings with her boss and his ""FLAIRS"" are also funny. This is a highly recommended comedy. I'm sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between Peter and his boss Lumbergh. And the character of his boss Lumbergh is delightfully hilarious: Especially the way he talks. The whole movie is very funny and wonderful. Highly recommended.

 	(3.5/5 stars) Listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly, ashen-faced with blank stares; where is the horror in that? Sounds like a typical Sunday afternoon at the mall to me. In fact, Dawn of the Dead (1978) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film. More or less picking up where ""Night of the Living Dead"" left off, zombies are on the hunt for prey across Pennsylvania. Four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies. They take refuge in a shopping mall, which provides just about everything they need. They work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure. The walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and don't bring much in the way of strategy. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they weren't so tenacious. The four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the TV of bombing areas of high zombie concentration. They have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere. What does fate have in store for them? ""The Night of the Living Dead"" took place, obviously, at night and in the dark, which provided a much more frightening backdrop. It was also in black and white, which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make-up. This is not the case with ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which is in color and takes place during daylight. The ""zombies"" are people dressed as they normally would, but with their faces painted grey. The result is anything but scary. Tom Savini's effects are hit and miss, though always disgusting. Nonetheless, this is a decent film that features some above-par acting and a decent script. The Anchor Bay Divimax DVD is also noteworthy, with a clean transfer and DTS sound mix. An extra ï¿½ star for the effort.

More or less where ""The Night of the Living Dead"" left off, zombies are hunting for prey across Pennsylvania. Four people arm themselves to the teeth with weapons and other equipment to survive the onslaught of the reeling zombies. They flee to a shopping mall that offers just about everything they need. They work together as a team and connect in the learning process that they have to endure. The dead are motivated by hunger alone and do not bring much strategy. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they were not so stubborn. The four know that they must hurry up, because television reports that zombie-dense areas are being bombed. They hope that this epidemic will be limited in its scope and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere. What does fate expect? ""The Night of the Living Dead"" was obviously played out in the night and in the dark, which provided a much more frightening backdrop."

 	Kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular ""Bloodsport"" and like Bloodsport, Kickboxer is no doubt a ""Van Damme classic"".  There are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences, however the acting suffers - worse than Bloodsport in that department.  As for the plot - revenge - go figure.  But we don't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie.  Hey, it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action.  Fortunately, Kickboxer delivers it well.  The movie begins with a couple of good fights right away.  About 1/2 of the movie is training sequences, but many are enjoyable to watch.  The final fight is between the villain, Tong Po (played by Michel Qissi) and Kurt Sloane (Van Damme).  Its a rather lenghty fight, about 10 minutes, which is nice.  Above all else, they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on, and yes the result is some blood during the fighting.  Kickboxer is the only martial art movie I know of that used this ""ancient Thai style of fighting"" (with the exception of Kickboxer 2 and a small scene in Ring of Fire).  I really enjoyed this.  I also enjoyed Michel Qissi.  He had maybe one line in the movie, but still succeeded in making Tong Po a great villain, who also will return in the sequal.  Lastly, we can't forget to mention the Van Damme dance - Napoleon Dynamite would be proud.  Also keep an eye out for Ong Soon Han (main villain in both Bloodsport 2 and Dragon:The Bruce Lee Story), who has a short fight against Tong Po about 1/2 way through the movie

387,"	Defines a different kind of movie
 	Maybe you've heard that ""it's all been done before."" Gaiman and McKean prove that wrong with this unique movie. It really is something new.

McKean has worked for years in the comic industry, defining a visual style that works at a visceral level. The style has many ways to look, depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy. Some times McKean's work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone, other times it's a pen-scrawl of some horrible fear trying to waken. Disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience. I never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life - well, I was wrong. This movie's imagery defies easy description. I can only invite you to see it for yourself, and to experience a movie that is truly like no other. The small-screen video makes me regret missingn the big-screen theater experience.

The sound track generally works well, too, from the surreal drone of Mrs. Bagwell's Victrola to the nightmare chant of the Jill-in-the-boxes during Helena's transformation. I'm not normally one to notice, but Mirrormask's music complements its look flawlessly.

You didn't come here for the story: light and dark in conflict, lost mystic artifact, plucky youth, untrustworthy side-kick. The acting doesn't distinguish itself either, despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes. Stephanie Leonidas does a good job in the Helena role, with a convincing sulky/sultry mix. If you liked the acting in the original Dr. Who series, this will rise to your highest expectations.

The story isn't the strength here. You'll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy.

 	I'm another of those who saw this at Sundance, and all the things I enjoy about Gaiman and McKean's graphic novels were on display: the quiet humor, the intelligence, the delightful weirdness, the astounding visual vocabulary. Except that in this case, the words are spoken by good actors, and all those visuals get up off their feet and move.

It's hard to describe the impact of watching a McKean painting move and talk. There might be those who quibble about the movie looking too ""animated,"" but of course that's exactly the point: to create a world and make it dance. The end result, visually at least, is like nothing you've ever seen before, and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone.

Some of the people I talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull, that they had seen it all before. Well, it's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve--a little ""Alice in Wonderland"" here, a little ""Time Bandits"" there, a lot of ""Wizard of Oz"" over here, not to mention a resemblance to Gaiman's own ""Coraline."" But I'm just as familiar with those stories as anyone else, and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of ""MirrorrMask""--after all, it's what you do with a story that determines its success. And from moment to moment, there was enough innovation and cleverness, enough delight and wonder, to make the movie a positive delight.

When the movie came out in theaters I went to see it again, and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog; then a friend of mine tried to show the DVD to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the spider-thingie. (Hey, in ""Wizard of Oz"" the moment when the Witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me--yet it lingered in memory, and when I got older I was drawn back and fell in love with the movie.  That's how this stuff works.)  ""MirrorMask"" was probably a little too wild to be a full-out commercial success; but I bet it's going to have a long, long shelf life on DVD as people pull it out to tell their friends ""Wait till you see this.

Dakota Fanning is as precious as ever and I hope she can avoid all the trappings of child stardom that have sapped some of the best child actors of the last 30 years (Todd Bridges, Jill Whelan, Eve Plumb).

This DVD really gives you a good idea at how amazing Incubus is live. Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers. Every song is a favorite of mine, and I absolutely love the way Brandon mixed things up on Pardon Me. Plus the little comments Brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch. I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet. The bonus features are splendid as well. If you watched everything this DVD has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably, there's that much on here. Just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs, Brandon recording Warning (a lot of this song is a capella), and Incubus showing how funny they really are. The original cut of the Wish You Were Here video is also on this, which is pretty humerous.

A few of the best songs on here are Pardon Me, The Warmth, Warning, New Skin, and Nice To Know You. As amazing and funny as the special features are, the standout is really the performance. I can't find any words that would do this show justice. I guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself

 	""Hello Vietnam,and greetings!"",says Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk in one scene of this film. It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian's brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian's stint. ""You oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music',not wild stuff"",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. ""Would Bob Dylan be out of line?"",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,""Way,way,way out of line!"". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,""Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls."" Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,""You suck,eat a bag of s--t!"". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson's superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grew tired of the seargeant's abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian's friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,""Good morning,Vietnam"",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian's departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,""Goodbye,Vietnam"" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn't GMV?

This movie is original, having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings, that eats people like birds eat worms.  This movie is a hybrid of Godzilla and slasher flicks.  This is definately B-movie material, but it's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories... and that is worth more than the price of admission

This moviemaker appears to be of the opinion that there are a lot of teachers who could have filled this role as well, or nearly as well. Well let me tell you, he is wrong. This teacher is special. There are not very many teachers as patient and diplomatic and considerate on this entire planet as Georges Lopez

403,"	Better Than Most Bio-Pics
 	Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood,"" a surreal bio-pic is one of the most entertaining, inspiring, and funny bio-pics I've seen. No wonder really since it's directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio-pic writers Scott Alexander  and  Larry Karaszewski (who, after this film, would pen the Larry Flynt bio-pic ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" and the Andy Kaufman bio-pic ""Man on the Moon""). It's also got an amazing cast of actors, including Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, 'Finding Neverland'), Oscar winner Martin Landau (Best Supporting Actor, 'Ed Wood'), Sarah Jessica Parker ('Failure to Launch'), Patricia Arquette ('True Romance'), Jeffrey Jones ('Deadwood'), and Oscar nominee Bill Murray
(Best Actor, 'Lost in Translation'). Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr., an aspiring filmmaker who's down on his luck and lives with his girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Parker). After hearing about a film being made about a transsexual, without a script, Ed pens a script called ""Glen or Glenda.""
The movie is kind of close to Ed's heart, because Ed likes to dress in woman's clothes. But he's not gay. While walking past a shop that sells coffins Ed meets the actor Bela Lugosi (Landau), who played Dracula in the classic Universal film and recruits him to star in the Glen or Glenda film. The movie immediately bombs and is called one of the worst films ever made. Not letting it get him down, Ed goes to work on his next film ""Bride of the Atom."" After a few more films and meeting a few new people, including wrestler Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele), TV personality Vampira (Lisa Marie), and psychic Criswell (Jones); Ed goes on to make his masterpiece ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" The latter is the only film I've ever seen by Ed Wood. While the movie has been called the worst film ever made, it wasn't bad. It's campy and stupid; You can definitely see why it would be considered bad back then, but it was entertaining and fun to watch. Ed Wood was an interesting, and quirky, guy...Which Tim Burton makes perfectly clear here and Depp does a great job bringing Wood to life. Martin Landau gives his finest performance as Bela Lugosi, he disappears behind the persona. He looks and sounds like Lugosi. Another thing I liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in Ed Wood's life, through his first film to his ""masterpiece."" We hear the downside of his life through the epilogue. This movie is, in the end, a loving tribute to ""B"" movies that is over-the-top yet perfect. As I said, the movie is very funny. Especially, Landau who gets some of the best lines as Lugosi. Bill Murray co-stars as Ed's transsexual friend Bunny.

 	This movie sounded stupid when I first heard about it. Who could make a 2 hour movie based on stripping at a club and have it make sense? Obviously, Ice Cube could. This movie stars LisaRaye in her film debut as Diana, who is known to the stripping world as Diamond, a hardworking college student who needs a better way to pay to get herself through school. While working at a shoe store, she meets Trixie (Adele Givens) and Ronnie (Chrystale Wilson). They convince her into quitting her low-paying job and working at The Player's Club, a run down joint owned by a lowlife loser named Dollar Bill (Bernie Mac). When Diana's cousin Ebony (Monica Calhoun) comes into town, she tells Diana that she wants to work at the player's club. Ebony gets caught up in this world and is drowning in the lows of ""using what you've got to get what you want"".

There is a terrific typhoon,  and  a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while. They torture the Captain, but he doesn't reveal where the gold is. Dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman, Wallace  Berry, against the Captain because she is mad at him. She of course changes her mind.

 	Marc Singer is a bloke from England who moved to New York City, saw all these homeless sleeping on the streets, and became friends with them.  They in turn trusted him, accepted him as one of their own, and showed him their secret living quarters.  Deep underground in abandoned train tunnels, the homeless erected huts out of anything scavenged off the streets.  Intelligent and resourceful, they had hooked up to free electricity and had working TV's and stoves.

What makes this documentary five stars instead of four is the making of documentary.  Only there do you learn that the movie crew WERE the tunnel folks.  Only there do you learn how Singer made this movie with no money, equipment, or knowledge of filmmaking.  This movie took six years from start to finish.  Unfortunately, it was not the financial success its producers hoped for.  But it resonates unbelievably.  

The deleted scenes are not to be missed, although some are much better than others.  The one where a man talks about how his cousin killed a cat for food, and the scene where two young men talk in X-rated detail about recent sexual activities lent nothing to the film

If you have seen the remake with Michael Douglas, pretend you haven't and watch the way it SHOULD be done.  If you've seen neither version of the film, get this one and get ready for anything.  

This is above all a classically sarcastic farce between two misfits who have amazing chemistry together.  Both Peter Falk and Alan Arkin are marvelous craftsmen, and their combination of silliness and genuine rolicking humor is blended in an almost non-stop pace from beginning to end.  Again (as I've said in other of my reviews), minor characters are important.  Ed Begley as the CIA boss adds weight and color to that aspect of the plot, and Richard Libertini as the South American dictator (I've never seen him play a sane character) adds another kind of raucous fun.

I think that (Kurt Russell), as Captain Ron was pretty funny. However, it was the antics of (Martin Short), who hires Captain Ron to sail his ship in the Caribbean, that was the funniest character in the film. The story begins when a relative of (Short) dies, leaving him a ship, which is moored at a small Caribbean island. The wife (Mary Kay Place) who is not too pleased at going to the island, decides to go along with this mid-life crises of (Short); on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat.

Enter Captain Ron (Kurt Russell). He is a very strange and quirky fellow, to the uptight and anxious (Martin Short). However, since (Short) knows nearly nothing about boating, he decides to hire Captain Ron on the suggestion and recommendation of the man who is interested in buying the boat. Therefore, Captain Ron, who is not very bright to begin with, leads the family [including Short's two children] on a cruise through the Caribbean: And he is a very eccentric character. Harmless, but funny. What ensues is a funny interaction between (Short) and (Russell) on their voyage. Including a scene where (Russell) warns (Short) not to stray from one particular islands path, due to Guerilla's on the island. Which (Short) interpets as Gorilla's. A very funny scene. Recommended, it is a family watch that your children can enjoy

 	Judy Garland, Marlena Deitrich, Shirley Bassey, and Marilyn Monroe are L.V.'s (short for Little Voice) best friends in the world!  On 33 1/3 LP's, that is!

L.V. Hoff, played specactularly by Absolutely Fabulous' Miss Jane Horrocks, is a timid, shy, mousy young girl who cloisters herself in her bedroom day after day and plays her dear, dead father's record collection over and over again.  You see, L.V. and her boisterous, overbearing, abusive pig of a mother, Mari played wonderfully by the great Brenda Blethyn live above the family business, Hoff Records.

Enter telephone men George and Billy, (Philip Jackson  and  Ewan McGregor). They install Mari's first phone in the Hoff's small flat.  Billy is a backward chap himself with only his homing pigeons as friends but once he meets L.V., he is smitten and so is she.

Mari, always on the lookout for a new beau, finds one in talent producer, Ray Say, played by a great Michael Caine.  So great, in fact that Michael was nominated for an Oscar for his performance of the producer/womanizer/lothario Mr. Ray Say. After Ray hears L.V. singing in her upstairs bedroom he knows he has found a star and pawns everything he owns to make money and exploit L.V.'s singing talent.

L.V. debuts at Mr. Boo's (Jim Broadbent) variety club but gets a terrible case of stage fright and ends up being ""booed"" off the stage.

Of course, Ray wants L.V. to try again so under the influence of Ray, Mari and her friend Sadie, played by Annette Badland, L.V. agrees to do one more show.  L.V. is a HIT with her impersonations of all her and her father's favorite singers and actors. Ray makes a BOATLOAD of money, wants L.V. to come away with him, Mari gets jealous and lots of other crazy things happen with a shocker of an ending that you won't forget!

This movie was adapted from the stage play of the same name that was written especially for Jane Horrocks in mind as Little Voice.   I don't understand how Miss Horrocks was passed over for an Oscar nomination herself.  She is splendid in this film as is the whole cast of characters.

Highly Recommended and Happy Watching!

416,"	Broken Hearts Club Full of Meanwhiles
 	Is it a bad thing to see a movie and deem it good by standards different from which you would judge other movies? Let me explain. 
Broken Hearts Club is a good movie. A little corny and certainly more than a little predictable. It doesn't really do anything new. BUT, for a semi-mainstream gay film, 
it breaks all the rules. 

Breeder hunks play femme gay men. There is no one with AIDS in the whole story. There are butch gay men in this movie. And no, none of the gay men has a best friend who is a single, white, straight female. Can you handle it? 

The movie is entertaining. The plot is sweet. The best part of the film is the style in which it is broken up. Ala' the television show Frasier, the movie is split into sections by definitions flashed on screen to help explain the next scene. The best definition has to do with 'meanwhile'. 'Meanwhile' 
being the gay term to tell your friend when an attractive male walks by. 

And the movie itself is filled with 'meanwhiles.' Dean Cain 
looks especially nice in this film and pulls off the character of a pretty boy with ease. Go figure. John Frasier leaves his comfortable role of an ex-cop on Frasier to be the father-figure of this group of friends and the coach of their softball team. Andrew Keegan is the newbie of the group- recently outed gay man. Finally, Kerr Smith, who has been playing a gay character on Dawson's Creek for some time, play the token gay character on a softball team of macho, testosterone-oozing fireman

419,"	The Man With The Hat
 	Based on the early-movie cliffhangers he used to watch in theaters, George Lucas created something special: a re-invention of the entire adventure genre. These films waited a long time to make their bow on DVD, much too long for myself, personally. I always loved these films, they had everything to keep your attention riveted all the time. Each of the three films is very different from the others. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the first and best of the three, introduces us to Indiana Jones, perhaps Lucas's greatest creation. Premiering in 1981, this film was a smash, also receiving an oscar nomination for best picture. Also starring was Karen Allen, perhaps the most even-matched female co-star for Harrisan Ford. It seemed she could give as good she got, and never backed down in any scene. Second was ""The Temple of Doom"", easily the darkest of the three, and the most intensely exciting. This film is a non-stop thrill ride from start to finish, and doesn't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or charactor. The third film, ""The Last Crusade"", is possibly the most balanced in terms of plot and charactor, and has the wonderful Sean Connery to steal every scene he's in. The interaction between Indy and Mr. Jones is wonderful. If anyone was to ever play Indiana Jones' father, it was Sean Connery. The forth disc in the set is nothing but bonus features, which are almost as entertaining as the films themselves. These films waited far too long to be released to DVD, and I lay the blame squarely on George Lucas. I've heard he really didn't think DVD would take off like it did, that it was just a phase. It's great he finally realized his mistake and released these fine movies for everyone to enjoy. As with his ""Star Wars"" trilogy, the Indiana Jones films are cinematic history and should be required for all DVD collections

These movies have waited a long time to make their bow on DVD, far too long for me personally. I've always loved these films, they had everything to capture your attention. Each of the three films is very different from the others. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" the first and best of the three, introduces us to Indiana Jones, perhaps Lucas's greatest creation. This film, which premiered in 1981, was a smash hit and was also nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture. Also starring was Karen Allen, perhaps the most equal female co-star for Harrisan Ford. She seemed to be able to give as good as she got, and didn't give in in any scene. Second, ""The Temple of Perdition"" was by far the darkest of the three and the most intense. This film is a continuous thrill ride from start to finish and doesn't really bother to delve too deeply into personal relationships or characters. The third film, ""The Last Crusade,"" is perhaps the most balanced in terms of plot and character, and has the wonderful Sean Connery who can steal every scene he's in. The interaction between Indy and Mr. Jones is wonderful. If anyone ever plays Indiana Jones' father, it's Sean Connery. The fourth disc in the set is nothing more than bonus features that are almost as entertaining as the films themselves. These films waited far too long to be released on DVD, and I lay the blame squarely at George Lucas's door. I heard that he really didn't think the DVD would go so fast that it was only a phase."
420,"	The story of a film genius
 	I saw this on PBS' Great Performances.  This documentary is about film genius Akira Kurosawa.  The documentary charts  Akira Kurosawa's early life in pre-WWII Japan to the end of his life.  Kurosawa brought Japanese cinema to a world wide audience. I recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Akira Kurosawa fan.  Plus the DVD has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the PBS program and Kurosawa filmography

421,"	A wonderful documentary about one of the truly great souls of the twentieth century
 	Dietrich Bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey.  His books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues, but practical issues of the greatest moment.  There is a great line in Kierkegaard, in the preface to THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH, where he writes:  ""Everything essentially Christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed; even if only medical experts understand it, it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person.""  What gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them, as he struggled to live out the implications of Christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so.

Bonhoeffer was in so many ways a paradox and the documentary does a great job of showing this.  Raised in a secular home, he inexplicably decided to become a theologian and pastor.  At a time when a host of right wing movements were overtaking Germany, he espoused left wing political and social values.  In an age of growing intolerance, he expressed a sympathy and understanding of both Jews and blacks almost unprecedented in the Germany of his time.  And in an age when many theologians wrote academic works with little regard to how they should connect with real life, Bonhoeffer was obsessed with the connections between thought and practice.  

What is most impressive in studying the life of Bonhoeffer, whether through reading his books or Eberhard Bethge's great biography or watching this documentary is the man's fundamental goodness and dedication to doing what is right.  If he had been catholic instead of protestant, he would surely by now have been declared a saint.  He seems to have had the saint's calmness and peacefulness.  One is certain that he slept the sleep of the just.

Bonhoeffer was one of the most promising young theologians in Weimar Germany.  Had he lived in more peaceful times he certainly would have written a host of first-rate theological works.  Like his theological mentor, the great Karl Barth, who was himself the greatest theologian between Luther and Calvin and the present, he would have written works that explored the concrete role that religion must play in every day life.  When Hitler rose to power, Bonhoeffer could easily have fled to the United States and taught through the course of the conflict and in fact had an appointment at Union Theological Seminary in New York, which he left to return to Germany.  Moreover, he joined the resistance against Hitler and came to believe that it was his moral and religious duty to aid in the attempt to assassinate him.  After an attempt to kill Hitler through the use of an air pressure bomb placed on a plane failed (for whatever reason it did not detonate as it should have), a host of suspected conspirators were arrested, including Bonhoeffer.  He spent the rest of his life in a Nazi prison, dying at the hands of the Nazis only a few days before the American armies liberated the concentration camp to which he was transferred near the end.

If one reads his ETHICS one is impressed by sections such as the one on what it means to tell the truth.  Kant had famously argued that if a man that one suspects is angry enough to kill a particular person comes up and asks you where that person is, the moral law demands that you not lie to the would-be murderer (though in Kant's defense it isn't clear that we are obligated to tell him where the intended victim is, but merely that we not lie).  For Bonhoeffer the situation is so much more complex.  He knew about many facets of the conspiracy and merely refusing to answer the Gestapo's questions would have done much to confirm the existence of the conspiracy.  Bonhoeffer was forced to systematically fabricate a tissue of lies that would mislead the Nazis as much as he could while protecting as many people as he could.  This lends a sense of poignancy to his writing on what it means to tell the truth that is almost unbearable.  Reading between the lines, one realizes that Bonhoeffer realized, contra Kant, that ""telling the truth"" might actually entail lying to the best of one's abilities.  

I had only one tiny complaint with the documentary.  I love Klaus Maria Brandauer as an actor.  He is a powerful and subtle performer, but his voice on the DVD is very hard to understand.  I don't know if his accent is too thick or if the recording has too much bass to be clear.  I found I could understand only a portion of what he was saying.  

Anyone who is moved by this documentary should certainly look further into Bonhoeffer's life and thought.  I once was privileged to be part of a group of thirty or so students who had a long conversation with Eberhard Bethge about Bonhoeffer.  Bethge features prominently in the film.  There is no question that if you were to read only one book on Bonhoeffer, his magisterial biography is the place to go.  It is massive, but it is unquestionably worth the effort.  I love Bonhoeffer's ETHICS, but it might be a tad too academic for the lay reader.  THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP, in which he makes his famous distinction between cheap grace and costly grace, is a wonderful book and can easily be read by someone without a strong theological background.  LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM PRISON, which collects things written from the time of his arrest to the end of his life, is justly celebrated as a classic religious work.  A TESTAMENT TO FREEDOM:  THE ESSENTIAL WRITINGS OF DIETRICH BONHOEFFER is a very fine anthology that collects writings from every period of his life.

I recommend this film as strongly as possible.  To me Bonhoeffer is one of the truly great Christian heroes of the past century, though his courage and sacrifice offers equal inspiration to non-Christians as well

The quality of the DVDs is wonderful and the added extras are very generous indeed, if some of these extras are not to one's taste, then fair enough, but the vintage material is absolutely fascinating and cleaned up to match the quality of the main feature.  

It is a shame that the Al Jolson number was removed from the compilation disc because it was not intended to be racially offensive when it was produced, but today's political correctness lobby inevitably takes its toll.  That said, we are left with a plethora of magnificence from Busby Berkeley which gladdens the heart and which left me euphoric because the quality of the release exceeded my expectations.  Thank you Warner Bros for the TLC you have lavished on this set, and you, dear reader, if you have not experienced the work of this great director before, I urge you please, please consider buying it - I can guarantee you will not be disappointed. This was Hollywood's Golden Age, so now you have the chance to experience it, PLEASE don't miss out

431,"	A study in cinematic poise
 	Visconti's film is significantly different from Mann's classic story. Aside from the obvious changes (Aschenbach being a composer instead of a writer, etc), there are many subtle touches that deepen the ambiguity of the character. For example: In the book, Aschenbach's wife is dead, and his daughter is grown up and married away. In the film, his daughter dies in childhood, and it is not clear whether his wife is alive or not when he visits Venice.

Another reviewer here called the film ""ambient""; I would add the word ""poised."" The camera lingers on scenes for many minutes; observations occur in planes of depth. The acting is often extremely subtle. The young man who plays Tadzio looks as if he is sculpted of alabaster. Compositions, lighting, settings, costumes and makeup are simply exquisite. Imagine if this had been photographed in 65mm!

DEATH IN VENICE probably looks better here than it ever did in theaters. The DVD transfer is superb, based on what appears to be a spotless, pristine source. The wide Panavision aspect ratio is faithfully preserved, anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Sadly, the original monaural soundtrack has not been remixed for stereo; but execept for some occasionally muffled dialog (which may be intentional), it still sounds very good.

The post-MTV generation will find this film tough going. Don't buy this if you're hoping to see police gondolas flip over and explode. :

 	{My review of THE VILLAGE mentions THE SIXTH SENSE more than it does THE VILLAGE, so here it is.}

I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane. 

Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that. 

My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress. 

THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters. 

That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start. 

(The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.) 

""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it. 

Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this? 

""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium."" 

That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all.

441,"	A Great DVD To Get The Young Ones Moving!!
 	I thought this was a wonderful DVD because of the following factors:

*The goal of this Billy Blank's DVD is to get kids off their feet and exercising.  In this day and age of television, video games, and a joke of physical education in schools, it's up to parents to stress the importance of regular fitness activity.

*The diversity is great.  The children on this DVD consist of both boys and girls, ages of about 5 to maybe 12 or 13 years old, all sizes from thin to slightly chubby, and different nationalities. 

*Billy Blanks is just a very good instructor and you can see why he's loved by young and old.  He motivates the kids and makes the moves entertaining for them, even throwing in a couple of old dance moves. :-)  Billy Blanks speaks from the heart and you can tell that he honestly wants everyone to be fit.

As far as the fitness level, I could see kids doing this but it gets a little trickier when you get to the floor exercises if you haven't exercised in a while.  The good thing about this particular DVD is since it's geared towards kids, Billy places less emphasis on getting moves perfect, his main focus is to get the kids to realize that exercise is fun.  

Overall, I think this is a great DVD to add to your collection.  It's something you and your kids can enjoy doing together.

442,"	An important film
 	Denzel Washington plays the legendary Steve Biko in this late-80's film, while Kevin Kline plays a top journalist who befriends Washington's character in South Africa. Denzel is my favorite actor, and although he doesn't get a lot of screen time, this is one of his strongest roles ever(and you know that's saying a lot). Not only does he nail down the African accent, but he portray's Biko's renown concern and persistence.
This movie was awesome for the first hour. I could not take my eyes off it! As the inevitable came around this point, the movie turns to Kevin Kline's character who's trying to escape South Africa and spread Biko's story and message. It drags on quite extensively(the movie is over 2  and  1/2 hours) but it still maintains, enough to keep it's five-star rating in my book. There were some other flaws, like how quickly Kline's character switched from hostility to befriending Biko. That happened so quickly I couldn't tell when they actually saw eye-to-eye. The film was beautifully shot, especially for the 1980's, and I love the scene where Biko is speaking at an outdoor stadium being held up by dozens of supporters. Keep an eye out for Joseph Marcell(Geoffry the butler from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) who has a couple crucial scenes at the end playing a character aptly named 'Moses.'
The reason this movie was so memorable to me was because it really got me thinking how oppressed black folks have been throughout history. Sure, other movies have depicted this and maybe display this better, but Sh##! To find out how black people were even kicked aside and discriminated against in South Africa was eye-opening! I am beginning to understand their frustration as a race, and even those in America, more and more. Seeing this movie, and being Caucasian myself, you get a sense of why the black brethren distrust the white man or see him as evil, and there's no propoganda or direct bashing of the white race in this film. Just depiction. I, myself, kind of feel like a jerk for what my race has done over all these years. And believe me, we may think this sh#t's resolved and straight today, but we got a long ways to go!
You really gotta hand it to Denzel. He's tackled some of the biggest black icons so effortlessly, not only Malcolm X, Reuben Carter, among others, but Steven Biko as well. He may just be an actor, but he must have some strong beliefs in his own race as well to portray legends like these! It would be great to see him start speaking up for his people and directly to his people, a la Bill Cosby. I got this movie off Amazon because I could not find it in stores, but I recommend searching for it yourself or buying it however you can..

443,"	Yundi Li has always interpreted music in a most natural way
 	I have heard both Arrau and Richter playing Liszt's B Minor Sonata and I am afraid I very much prefer the way Yundi Li had played this piece. Perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as Arrau's technique was always not that impressive.

Yundi Li is not just a virtuoso. You are impressed not only by the shattering way he played for the more emotional part of this piece ( when Liszt was supposed to struggle with his other side of character), you will also be impressed by his every subtle nuance for the lyrical part of the music which you seldom hear from others. You will also appreciate all the smooth transitions he made from one theme to another. Will I be able to hear a better and a more logical Liszt's B Minor Sonata than this?

I believe Yundi Li is capable of very deep feeling when he plays. You seldom find one pianist more deeply immersed in the music during performance than Yundi Li . Music just flow out from his fingers in a most natural way as a result of such deep feeling. I particularly agree with this description of Yundi Li:

""What distinguishes this uniquely gifted young artist from most of his contemporaries is his ability to put his personal stamp on a work without resorting, even for a single gesture, to eccentricity.""

Although Richter was technically more capable compared with Arrau, I have always found him not expressive enough for pieces that require more rubati. You will be impressed by his technique for some Beethoven Sonata.

444,"	A Blossoming Career Deserves A Better Production Than This
 	Li is no heavy-weight pianist. Neither is Bunin or even Zimerman. And don't foeget that Chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all. And judging from the steam and progess Li has made, Lang Lang's position is certainly under threat. And any viewer who is interested in Li or how Chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this-- here we have to thank Martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the Chopin Competition. Now in his mid-twenties, and musically out of almost nowhere, Li is already a full fledged musician.   

Of course, viewers should not compare him with Arrau's fine balance between the extreme high and rather low register; or his scales with Richter's.  This is not fair, for Arrau and Richter are such great artists. Li is already so close to Zimerman now. 

Furthermore, what we hear may have more to do with the accoustics of the hall, something which has more to do with the engineers than the performer himself. And I say so because I'm a bit concerned about the quality of the picture of this DVD. It appears to me more like a VCD than DVD production (or somewhere in between): it is slightly below average DG production and the camerawork is also average only. This is obviously not fair to a blossoming career that Li is now having. One star is taken for want of a better production.

However, like other people who also liked the show, I have to agree with them to release all of the episodes (for goodness sake! I can't believe they didn't put in the Customers Suck episode because that was hysterical and the only one I have ever seen when the show was on TV) because we want to see and have all of the episodes, not just 80% of them and never get to see the other ones.

 	The professional reviewer missed the main point of Jeffrey's dilemma. He's not so afraid of getting AIDS; he's afraid of falling in love with a man who then dies of it. Most people figure a 50% chance of dying before their spouse; but taking on a person with a known, fatal disease throws those odds way out of kilter and creates a desperate, poignant situation.

Steve Weber is no gayer than George Bush but he certainly is an enthusiastic kisser. This was the first film I saw Michael Weiss in and he totally had me convinced he was gay. I knew Patrick Stewart isn't, but his performance is dead on.

Overall, a very funny movie with a big, big heart

453,"	Col. Kurtz IF he had survived ""Apocalypse Now""
 	Ever wonder where Col. Kurtz would've ended up if he had survived the end of ""Apocalypse Now""? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals -- the horror, the horror.

In light of all the bad press one would really think this is a lousy movie. And I can see WHY some people don't like it, the main portion of the flick is really INSANE. However, if you're a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the heavy mood  and  insanity of ""Apocalypse Now,"" you'll probably like it. I'm not saying it's anywhere near as great as ""Apocalypse Now"" but Marlon Brando and the jungle insanity make the comparison inevitable. 

WHAT WORKS: The title sequence is great, perhaps one of the best in all of cinema (another Amazon reviewer noted this, so I'm not alone); the soundtrack is phenomenal ('nuff said); the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up is fine ('Hyena' looks especially horrific); the film possesses an undeniable creative pizzazz (i.e. it's moody, atmospheric and insane); and Marlon Brando's 35 minute stint in the film is as captivating as always (you can probably tell I'm a huge Brando fan -- in particular, ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962), ""The Young Lions,"" ""Superman"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" [not ""Redux""]). 

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The third act of the film is almost total insanity, except for the final ten minutes or so; as a result the story will lose the interest of those who have no appreciation for such artistic flair.

CLOSING THOUGHTS: I really enjoyed seeing Brando in his old age in this flick; it proves he had his magnetic charm until the end. If you enjoyed Brando as 'Kurtz' in ""Apocalypse Now"" you'll appeciate him in ""Island;"" in fact, as already noted, Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz in his old age (i.e. nutjob in the jungle).

If you're predisposed for such a flick, ""Dr. Moreau"" is weird, but certainly worthwhile.
",1,"IF he had survived ""Apocalypse Now,"" one wonders where Colonel Kurtz would have ended up if he had survived the end of ""Apocalypse Now""? Now we know: he banished himself to a desert island to create humor - horror, horror. Given all the bad press, you'd think this is a lousy film. And I can see why some people don't like it, the main part of the film is really INSANE. But if you're a seeker for Lost-on-an-Island yarns and appreciate the heavy mood and madness of ""Apocalypse Now,"" you'll probably like it. I'm not saying it's anywhere near as great as ""Apocalypse Now,"" but Marlon Brando and the jungle madness make the comparison inevitable. WHAT TO AVOID: The title sequence is terrific, perhaps one of the best in the whole movie (another Amazon reviewer noted that, so I'm not alone); the soundtrack is phenomenal (""sniff said); the plot is fascinating; the humorous mask is fine ("" hyena ""looks particularly awful); the movie has an undeniable creative pizzazz (i.e., it's a real movie. It's moody, atmospheric, and insane); and Marlon Brando's 35-minute involvement in the film is as compelling as ever (you can probably say I'm a big Brando fan - especially ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962), ""The Young Lions,"" ""Superman"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" [not ""Redux""]). WHAT TO DO: The film's third act is almost total madness, with the exception of the last ten minutes or so, which means the story loses interest in those who don't understand such artistic flair. CONCLUSIONS: I enjoyed Brando in this movie very much in his old age; it proves that he had his magnetic charm to the end. If you liked Brando as Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now,"" you'll appreciate him in ""Iceland""; in fact, as mentioned earlier, Dr. Moreau is a variation on Kurtz in old age (i.e., he's a man in the role of Kurtz). Nutjob in the Jungle). If you're predestined for such a film, ""Dr. Moreau"" is strange, but worth it."

455,"	Casts Made In Heaven
 	Casts were chosen by the author Hemingway himself. That short comment on this film opening was really the miracle. Particularly Gary Cooper as American dynamiter Roberto and Ingrid Bergman as hapless young girl Maria could happen only through the number of miracles.

SPAIN IN YOUR BACKYARD
As the movie opening says shooting took place Sonora Pass in California not in Spain. Isn't it ironic because Sierra Nevada Mountain Range itself was named by Spanish reminding them of the homeland mountains when they occupied the part of California.

BONDED BY MOVIE DEAL
At that time movie actors were strongly tied by contracts and that prevented both Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman from the role Hemingway wanted on the film. To win him the movie company had to pay huge money and Maria took it by accicent. She even cut her own hair to be Maria eventually sacrificing the next movie 
role. 

DELETION OF POLITICAL ASPECT
That is why the movie became successful and became a very entertaining one. The movie focus on the love development between Maria and Roberto which was excellently shown though a bit old-fashioned. Bergman's Maria was so natural and you can see how far she was into the role. But the time provided another politics: American hero fighting against Dictatorship an ally of Nazi and Facists. That worked far better than any of government sponsored war propaganda I suppose.

SUPPORTING ACTORS and ACTRESS
Supporting actors and actresses did the job quite well particularly I think ANSELMO was well performed. PABLO was also nicely acted particularly Pablo grinning at the scene of falling snow is truly scary reminding me of Jack Torrarence of SHINING.
PILAR is a bit of letdown but not bad. 

THE ENDING
I suppect there was alternative version where Roberto could survive but the ending place it quite vague. Old fashioned theatrical ploy. I see why BUTCH CASSIDY and SUNDANCE KID ends the similar way.

THE BRIDGE
Why must an American explode the bridge at THE BRIDGE AT RIVER KWAI? The answer might be here. 

REAL AMERICAN DYNAMITER
Hemingway might have probably heard of the story of American dynamiter somewhere and combined his own self to create the hero Robert Jordan. THE GOOD WAR interviews the model of Robert Jordan, Irvin Goff. It is said Maria was created by the image of Ingrid Bergman.

Verdict: Very entertaining movie
Rating: 91 out of 100 The presence of Ingrid Bergman alone contributes 10 point plus.
Recommended for any of classic movie fans

456,"	DVD's don't wear out, thankfully!
 	I never bought the VHS tape, but when I was notified this would be coming out on DVD, I ordered it. While I'm not an amateur, I am a professional, Eric is a guitarist's guitarist. Anyone who thinks he don't need learnin' is a fool and only famous in his own little world, small as it may be. I'm not that arrogant.

As Danny Gatton was known as the Humbler, Eric Johnson could rightly be called the Inspiration. What he does is not so much difficult as it is the epitome of finesse and transparency of technique. After viewing this, you will understand what I mean.

I already know much of what Eric teaches in this session, for that is what it is, a private session (much like you might get at GIT), with a master at the top of his craft. But there is always something to learn even after repeated viewings. I even scanned in the booklet that comes with this so I can break the lessons down and blow up the individual charts for more easy reading.

If you are serious about improving as a player, and if you're looking to be a real professional, you need to get this, if only to see what true professionalism looks and sounds like. The lessons are clear and focused. And with the booklet and the new ability to slow down the examples, you really can learn to play these things. But don't expect to sound like Eric (just as those who tried to, but could never sound like Jimi Hendrix).

You are different and so will always sound different, and that's a plus. But the techniques and all that are included here are part of a ""must learn"" program you need to create and follow if you want to at least make a good living playing music.

Learn from a master of melody and technique, where technique doesn't get in the way of the melody, but lives in service to the song -- the way it should be.

I teach, too. And I recommend to any student who wants to grow that they should get this DVD. If you get no other, this would serve whatever style you choose to pursue, ultimately, because there is so much here that can be applied to virtually any style, whether it is Jazz, Country, Blues, Rock or even acoustic (which I wish he would have included a segment on that, my only kvetch)

I already know a lot of what Eric teaches in this session, because that is a private session (similar to what you could get at GIT), with a master at the top of his profession. But even after repeated reflection, there is always something to learn. I even scanned the included booklet to break down the lessons and inflate the individual charts for easier reading. If you are serious about improving as a player and if you want to be a true professional, you have to get that, if only to see what true professionalism looks and sounds like. The lessons are clear and focused. And with the booklet and the new ability to slow down the examples, you can really learn to play these things. But you shouldn't expect to sound like Eric (just like those who tried but never could sound like Jimi Hendrix). You are different and you will always sound different, and that is a plus."
457,"	A steamy, genuinely suspenseful thriller
 	Sea of Love is certainly a better than average steamy crime thriller, but it didn't really bowl me over.  Pacino's very good, of course, and Ellen Barkin more than holds her own against him, but Pacino's character can become tiresome after a while, and what I regard as a pretty sizeable red herring thrown into your lap midway through the story makes the ending a little less dramatic.  I'm not saying the mystery is predictable - it's just not that shocking of a surprise.  

Frank Keller (Al Pacino) isn't exactly Steve McGarrett material when it comes to his career as a detective, mainly because the guy is basically pretty pathetic.  His wife left him for another detective on the force, and he's not handling that very well - drunken calls in the middle of the night to his ex-wife are not uncommon.  The guy drinks like a fish all day and all night, whether he's on duty or not, he gets into serious shoving matches with other cops, and he spends more time getting under the skin of his fellow detective (and ex-wife's new man) than investigating the crime at the scene of the film's opening murder.   Later on, he gets into a serious relationship with one of the murder suspects, which has to break a lot of rules in the old code of conduct.  About all he gleans from the first murder is the fact that someone plugged a fat naked guy in the back of his head and that the killer was apparently a big fan of the song Sea of Love.  Fortunately for him, a Queens detective (played by John Goodman) working on a similar case teams up with him on a two-man task force to find the mutual killer.  The common thread linking the murders together is the fact that each victim had recently placed a poetic personal ad in the newspaper.  Since no one seems to have bothered looking at any of the evidence too closely, Keller and Detective Sherman (Goodman) decide to place a similar ad in the paper, meet all of the women who respond, get their prints and compare them with those found at the murder scenes, and break the case wide open.

Keller meets Helen (Ellen Barkin) at one of these undercover dates.  She blows him off early on, before she even comes close to leaving a fingerprint on anything.  When they meet accidentally soon thereafter, though, a spark is lit, and the two are lovers before you can say Jack Sprat.  Frank puts his feelings for Helen above his job, thereby leaving Helen hanging out there as a possible murder suspect.  This is where all of the suspense comes in; is she or isn't she?  The story zigs and zags both ways on the question, leaving the viewer in a measure of doubt until the very end.  The whole thing turns into a weird love story for the most part, with Frank trying to avoid losing Helen even as he sometimes wonders whether she's the killer he's looking for.  It is quite suspenseful, largely thanks to Ellen Barkin's very strong performance.  The ultimate ending's a little weak, but that takes nothing at all away from the sustained mystery that will command your rapt attention all the way up to that point.  

It's not hard to see why the movie was so successful.  It just goes to show what good acting and a reasonably strong script can do for a movie.  There are probably two camps when it comes to the ending, I should note - but it's not a hate it or love it thing.  Some will not find it all that surprising, while others may feel as if it comes right out of left field.  Either way, Sea of Love is a film that all fans of steamy thrillers can lose themselves in and, at the very least, come out feeling reasonably satisfied

Later he gets into a serious relationship with one of the murder suspects, who has to break many of the rules of the old code of conduct.

 	There are so many reasons to like ""Wild Things"" it's easy to call this movie perfect. Although it's not the best movie ever made (or even in the Top 20 for that matter) it truly is a perfect movie...For what it could've been. I borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it, it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity. Well, this movie does have a plot and it's quite complicated. Some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes, but you can't argue that this is a damned good movie. Matt Dillon stars as Sam Lombardo, a guidance counselor at Blue Bay High School. Lombardo is a lady's man, in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he's done half of Blue Bay. Well, Lombardo has a student named Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards, who i've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie) who seems to be coming onto him; Lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother Sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in Blue Bay. Well, one day Kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash Lombardo's car for the senior car wash and then we see Kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face. Then, Kelly says Lombardo raped her. Lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer (Bill Murray). Well, then another girl named Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) says Lombardo raped her as well. Another player in the plot is Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon), the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories. Now, this movie is one of those films where you think you know what's going on and then they throw a wild card. After that, you think you know what's going on again and then s*it happens. Even when the movie ends, you don't know the full story until the credit sequence. The sex scenes (the most famous with Denise Richards, Matt Dillon, and Neve Campebell) are quite nice, but surprisingly the movie would be good without them. This is a really great movie and worth the $5 bucks it would cost to buy it.

 	First off I agree with the warning to not watch the trailer first because it does give away the first set up in the movie.  When Denise Richards sees Matt Dillion and his student having a water fight os such and says something like, ""Is this just a game for the boys, or can anyone play?"" She looks so sweet and hot that it's hard to imagine her getting rough and tough just a while later.  However she pulls ift off pretty well.  In fact they all pulle their rolls off pretty well.  I couldn't understand why Kevin Bacon seemed a bit stiffer than usual, but that was actually pretty good acting....I can't really say much more about why without giving too much of a hint at one of the twists, but it's interesting when you step back and see what he was actually doing.
 I give it 5 stars because it's both fun and funny, and of course very hot at times.  Well worth a look...

461,"	Charlie delivers in full HD glory
 	This movie looks simply amazing! The color, texture and detail provided by HD-DVD are superb, this is a showcase title for the format. First a word about my setup, which is nice but far from optimal. The HD-DVD player is connected via HDMI to a Sanyo PL-Z4 projector, with an approximately 140"" picture thrown onto a light beige wall. The room has little in the way of light control so we watch movies in the evening when there is less ambient light leaking through opaque cloth shades. Hardly the ideal environment to view a movie for most home theater afficionado's but my family and I thoroughly enjoy watching titles no less for it.

Now about the title - there are no compression artifacts or mosquito noise to be found anywhere. None. I also bought this title on SD-DVD and have watched on an upscaling DVD player, both on a 57"" crt bigscreen and the projector, and there are a distracting number of the aforementioned artifacts and mosquito noise in both cases. They're most noticeable on large surface solid colors, of which there are many in this movie. You'll see them ""dance"" and shimmer on SD-DVD, not so on HD-DVD. 

The colors are bold and bright when appropriate, but what really struck me while watching the title were the drabbish gray scenes such as the snow-covered streets of the town with the factory looming in the background. You can make out more detail, without any obvious edge enhancement problems found in the original SD-DVD version. The lights from the townsfolk dwellings were suffused with a soft glow in this latest version, not a ringed mess.

The story itself is not necessarily an improvement over the original, rather its told from a slightly different perspective, giving more insight into Willie Wonka's character, and updating the other kids (Violet, Mike Teavee, etc...) to reflect a newer generation of youngsters. Mike feels a bit weak, he's portrayed as a videogame crazed violent kid in the sequence that introduces his character, then sort of disappears into the background the rest of the movie. Veruca and Violet by contrast are more prominently featured, and you'll develop more antipathy towards their characters by their actions throughout the movie. Augustus also suffers a bit but since he's the first to get ousted from the party, it's logical that he won't be as fully developed as a character. His romp through the initial scene whilst in the factory is pretty good however.

Overall I'd give this 5 stars not only as a visual and audible feast for HD-DVD owners, but felt the movie was a great update to the original and stands on its own merits, even in SD-DVD presentation

Kiefer Sutherland, Jeff Bridges, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!  
The setting, the plot (Jeff's strong sense of love, devotion, and determination are admirable and commendable, and an example for all to follow!), the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!
In short, The Vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

 	The premier American cinematic drama is the western, and this collection brings together some bona fide classics from the golden age of westerns. This set comes with twelve discs each packaged in a cardboard slipcase with brief descriptions of the plot, every disc is double sided and contains two films on each side. There aren't any extras aside from a limited amount of scene selections.

It's true that the majority of these are b-films, and some are unintentionally hilarious to view today. There are some definite classics (McClintock, Under California Stars) along with plenty of simply enjoyable films.

Just a note, there are a few mistakes. For example, ""The Santa Fe Trail"" included on this set is *not* the 1930 Richard Arlen version. It's the 1940s Errol Flynn, Olivia Haviland version - which I personally feel is superior anyway. Also, some films were taken either directly from television (you'll see a IN STEREO flash across the screen when you play the film) or didn't transfer very well (slight distortions in video or audio) - but considering the age of these movies and the cheap price tag this is an amazing deal!

 	The first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of USMC boot camp I have ever seen, outside of actually being there. I've read that R. Lee Emery, who played the senior drill instructor, was initially hired to coach other actors for the role. But he did such a perfect job himself that Stanley Kubrick hired him for the job. If the film had ended after the first half alone, it would have been phenomenal.

The second half of the film portrays the same boot camp Marines from the first half who are now in Viet Nam. The tone and the setting are much different as the men engage in a number of battle situations, including a fairly gruesome scene with a female sniper. 

Where the first half of this film is almost comical at times, the second half is much more serious and grave. Overall, this is a serious and engaging movie that brilliantly describes military experiences on and off the battlefield

 	This is one of my favorite horror movies of the 1980s.  It's an updated version on an old theme:  Save the young heroine from the evil, blood-sucking vampire.

Chris Sarandon (Lifetime Movie Channel staple) has an absolute field day playing the villainous Jerry Dandridge.  Amanda Bearse (""Married with Children"") plays Amy, the young high school target of Dandridge's desires.  And William Ragsdale (a Hollywood newcomer at the time) plays Charley, the young hero who does his best to convince others to help him save Amy.

No one really believes Charley's rantings that his new neighbor next door is a vampire.  Charley's geeky best friend (played devilishly well by Stephen Geoffreys) doesn't believe him; nor does Amy.

Desperate, Charley enlists the help of has-been horror actor and TV host ""Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer.""  Equally desperate, Vincent takes the job as Charley's ""savior"" because he was fired as TV host and needs the money.

Roddy McDowall plays Peter Vincent extraordinarily well - first as an actor out to (wink-wink) ""convince"" Charley that Jerry Dandridge is NOT a vampire, and then genuinely terrified when he discovers evidence that Charley's suspicions are true.

Dandridge, upon meeting Amy, sees her unearthly resemblance to a woman he once loved.  He is immediately infatuated with the young girl. 

But first, realizing his secret is out, Dandridge acts quickly to rid himself of the problem of Charley and his pesky friends.

The special makeup effects in this film are terrific and imaginative.  The script is tightly written and well acted and Tom Holland's direction makes it work.  (Holland's other works include ""Child's Play,"" ""Thinner,"" ""The Temp,"" and ""Thinner"").

The DVD transfer is sharp and clean.  The disc features both a standard full screen version (4:3) and a widescreen version (2.35:1).  Sound is presented as 2-channel, Dolby Surround.

The only DVD extra is the theatrical trailer.  Sub-titles are available in several languages:  English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.  The disc is also close-captioned for the hearing impaired.

",1,"It starts... This DVD kick-off is the longest running animated prime-time show ever. The first season was an experience for the show. There are many solid episodes in this 13 episode season like Bart the General, Call of the Simpsons, Krusty gets broken and some enchanted evenings. I will review and rate each episode. Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire: Homer becomes Santa Claus in the mall to make money for Christmas. 8.7 / 10 Bart the Genius: Bart cheats his amplitude test at school and is sent to a genius school. 8.9 / 10 Homer's Odyessy: Homer is fired from the power plant and becomes a crusader for citizen safety in Springfeld. 8.6 / 10 There's No Disgrace Like Home: Homer tries to make his family more civilized. 8.8 / 10 Beard the General: Bart tries to get Nelson Muntz, the school bull, back on his feet. 9.0 / 10 Moaning Lisa: Lisa is depressed and meets Bleeding Gums Murphy. Homer tries to beat Bart in video games. 8.0 / 10 The Simpsons Call: The Simpsons are stuck in the jungle after their camper van crashes off a cliff. 9.1 / 10 The Telltale Head: Bart saws off Jebediah Springfeld's head to impress Jimbo Jones and his friends. 8.5 / 10 Life in the fast lane: Marge takes bowling lessons and falls in love with Jaques, the bowling instructor. 8.3 / 10 Homer's Night: Marge is angry with Homer after Bart takes a photo of Homer dancing with a belly dancer."

 	This is one of my favorite movies of all time--having it on DVD so I can select a scene just makes it better.  The only complaint I have is that there are no subtitles available (at far as I can tell)--otherwise it's great--a faithful rendition of a classic story.  I think Jane Austen would be pleased.

472,"	Mysterious symbols?
 	Ok, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo.
Those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters.
They are the traditional ""Mars"" and ""Venus"" symbols representing masculinity and femininity.
 
I also understand the last symbol representing ""infinity"", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of ""eternal life"" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity.
 
But what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol??? 

Are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values?
(The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity)

I haven't seen the movie in years but I don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot.

 	Okay, how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants?  Unless you were one of the misery causing bee-otches, you didn't.  This movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena, but takes a good crackshot at the mothers (Kirstie Alley's character is a real gem!).  It also makes fun of the people in Minnesota.  I see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film, but heard the term ""midwest"" used far more often.  We feel your pain, but I would have laughed had they picked my state (which is very close to MN).  They poke fun at hunters, Lutherans (yes, I'm one), and lutefisk for lunch in high school (I'm also of Norwegian decent).  

The most fun to be had is the way this movie spoofs how nasty women can be regardless of class warfare, and what lengths some of them will go to just to get their way.  Funny and dead-on like the nailhead beneath a hammer, this movie is a nasty and fun treat for everyone who has ever been treated badly by the so-called local uppercrust.  Enjoy 100 minutes of vengeance, and then go out into the world feeling better about the fact that you're definitely not alone!

475,"	Modigliani: Beautiful
 	Art history has always been an interest of mine, and I'm a big fan of other art movies such as ""Girl With a Pearl Earing"" and ""Merchant of Venice."" So when I found out about Modigliani I was happy to take the time to go watch it. Not only was it worth my time, but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion wasn't looked fondly on. 

Everything about the movie is amazing, from the sets to the acting. I feel this is one of Andy Garcia's best films in some time, not only is he convincing, but he fits the part of Modigliani better than any other actor could. They focused the movie around his rivalry with Picasso, which I find to be one of the most interesting things about it. You don't only get an insight into one artist, but many. You see the life the artists were living and the obstacles they had to overcome to get their art out into the world. 

Modigliani also had a tragic romance with a young catholic girl, who's father didn't want her with the struggling painter. The story is the perfect depiction of the religious standards in that time period. 

Overall this was a great movie, and I would strongly suggest that you take the time to check it out. You won't regret it, it's probably one of the best movies of the year

 	I have both Madonna Grimes workouts DVD's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts.  It was a great way to start my day, I was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same, but with disapointment comes satisfaction.  The other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts, and learn a workout that I never thought that I would learn and enjoy doing.  Jayna's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning,  also great moves you can use for other reasons.    Rania's upper body is really fun, some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot.  Suhaila workout I am intimidated by. I have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it.  I have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks.  She can contract them one at a time.  Some mornings I get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape. They are really fun. This tape has a bonus YOGA, I had never tried YOGA and this gave me an opportunity to try it.

478,"	Classic movie that's open to interpretation
 	I just finished watching When Harry Met Sally for probably the tenth time.  It's been years since I've seen it and I enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend.  I couldn't get over the fact that I still laughed several times, almost as if I'd never seen the movie before.

My interpretation, after all these years, was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments, infatuation, etc. without stooping to sugary sentiment.  I took Harry and Sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable.  I didn't see them as somehow representative of ""all men"" or ""all women.""

Then I watched the extra documentary on the DVD which I had never seen until now.  Big mistake.  My new ""interpretation"" of the film was suddenly cast aside as I remembered that I actually didn't like this movie as much when it first came out.  

Over time I had grown to accept the fact that I could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved.  What I had forgotten was Billy Crystal's, Rob Reiner's (director) and Nora Ephron's (writer) agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders.  Gag.

The views of the characters are presented as if they were fact.  Men supposedly always think about sex and can't be friends with women.  Most if not all women have faked an orgasm.  All men are clueless to the fakery.  And so on.

I can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the Boomer generation and older folks (no one on this film is even close being a member of Gen X) because this does not represent the reality of all humans.  You'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to ""prove"" their case.  If they'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it - ""No, I won't fake it.  If he sucks in bed I'm going to tell him."" And as for men, some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it.

None of this changes this classic film.  That's the great thing about art - it's open to interpretation.  I can watch this film and define it my way - two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love. Otherwise, I'd hate this movie.  But I won't give Reinder, Ephron et al that much power.  Just because they were narrow minded about gender roles doesn't mean I have to be about their film.

If you agree with the characters in the film, by all means, watch the documentary.  But if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters, pass it by.  Don't let a DVD extra taint your pov

 	This movie is a real departure for the director, Akira Kurosawa, in that it blends his humanistic inspirational-type movies, like ""Ikiru"" with a bit of action and drama ""Yojimbo, Sanjuro.""  The majority of the movie follows a young and arrogant doctor forced to work in a rural and poor region of Japan under a domineering senior doctor.  Naturally, everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour.  Midway through the movie, out of nowhere, one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission.  It is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief, confusing, and brutal.  Toshiro Mifune and Kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director's work changed radically.  Still good, but I'll always prefer the b and w epics the two of them made together.

I thought the story was great,  with good twists.The whole cast is very attractive, which can't hurt either. The ""bad"" characters are all pretty likeable, aside from one, and all is well in the end. The best thing about this movie is the character Cassidy. I sarted out hating her, and ended up really liking her for her realness, and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b*tch.

It's much better than different actors playing old characters, which drags a movie down a lot. I thought the story was great, with good twists and turns. The entire cast is very attractive, which can't hurt. The ""bad"" characters are all pretty likeable except for one, and in the end everything is good. The best part of this film is the character Cassidy. I hated her and found her very likeable for her authenticity and honesty, and she's not trying to hide that she's a b * tch. This actress does her thing exceptionally well, pulling off both lovable and complete brats at the same time. I would definitely recommend this film."
492,"	Cinderella Soccer Story
 	Goal! is a well-done soccer version of the road to glory in athletics.  It is a true Cinderella story that makes the impossible possible and fulfills the one in a million shot at stardom.  

The soccer player, a young hispanic man in Los Angeles, gets a one-time chance to tryout for English Premier League power Newcastle.  As the movie progresses, more and more people believe in the young man's dream.

His family relationships are present and well-developed in the movie as is a budding romance.  We see the young player learn about the consequences of his decisions.  There are enough conflicts and challenges in this movie that keep it interesting.

The soccer presented in the movie is very well-done. We see actual professional players make cameo's on and off the pitch..no headbutts, though.  A few times I felt like I was watching an actual English Premier League game...there are just a few too many spin moves over the ball but they look cool.

This is a good movie with a good begining and good ending. I am glad I watched it and recommend it especially to soccer fans

 	This movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out.  An excellent and energetic movie from the start. Plot is cutesy.  It serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences.  However, I think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes?  I would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me.

If memory serves me, didn't Alex receive a letter from her friend, Hannah, when Alex discovered Hannah passed away?  Isn't there a reconnection at the end between Mickey and Alex's (girl)friend whom the latter was dating?  Wasn't there more of a story build-up between Alex and her boss?  If this version is cut in anyway, I prefer getting the complete and unedited version.  I find this version incomplete somehow.

But Jennifer Beals looks terrific and one wonders why she didn't star in more movies for her generation

 	Now, THIS is a rock n' roll show from Rock's ""good guys"". Pearl Jam is probably the most important band ever in American music. They are to the US what Led Zeppelin was to Britain. This concert is a fantastic representation of their mature post-millenium shows. No, you won't see a lot of crowd-surfing or moshing any more from these 30 and 40 somethings, just a LOT of great music, and wonderful lyrics. Mike McCready is quite possibly one of the world's most underrated, soulful guitarists, and his playing just sounds even better when you can see what those fingers are doing. At first, I was not a fan of adding Boom Gaspar to the shows, but I have come to quite enjoy his contributions and pretty much consider him a bona fide member of the band, as I do Matt Cameron, who filled in a ""revolving throne"" back when Jack Irons left due to back problems after ""Yield"".

There are some true gems on this recording, and the concert goes on and on with LOTS of music and a nice long encore. The crowd is in the thing from the beginning, and the band is ""on"" and every member is in their 'zone', and seems to be having a fantastic time...only Cameron, true to form, seems a bit ""stoic"". Highlights of this DVD are ""Lukin"", ""Black"", ""Thumbing my Way"", ""Last Exit"", and ""Save You""; however, the band just goes to a heavenly plane with ""Low light"", ""Faithful"", and ""In My Tree"". There ain't much from versus and 10 on this one, with the band more oriented towards their more ""organic"", ""laid-back"", and ""vibey"" post-Vitalogy feel, which has turned off some of the ""hard rocking"" PJ fans; however, if you listen back, PJ has always had the pensive, laid back rockers, even in the explosive days of the early 90's with songs like ""Black"", ""Daughter"", ""Alive"", ""Oceans"" and the like. Just because the band has chosen to explore other instruments and rhythms and to mature as a complete organism has caused some to reject them because they don't rock ""hard enough""...

And that is ridiculous, as one will see on these DVD's. This is the best representation of PJ's wonderful live shows on ""official"" record. Ben Harper makes a wonderful appearance or two, as does Tony Barber, the Bass player for the Buzzcocks, who is forever immortalized on DVD for not knowing the bassline for ""Sonic Reducer""...

Overall, the performance is just about as tight as a live performance gets, and the camera angles and picture quality is pretty good most of the time. The extras are good, but Ed's solo guitar version of ""Dead Man"" stands out as a heartfelt, amazing performance. ""Down"", an underrated song from the B-side record, ""LOst Dogs"", is merely a backdrop for some behind-the-scenes footage, which is fine, but I'd much rather HEAR what the boys are saying, and see a LIVE performance of the song...

If you're a fan of Rock and Roll or Pearl Jam, you already own this DVD. If you're just now waking up from your coma, then get this NOW! Study it, learn the methods of PJ, and you, too, can become the best band in America! Ex-Frat Boys who only know ""Even Flow"" and ""Alive"" need not apply..

501,"	Edge of your seat suspense!
 	While Roman Polanski was avoiding authories in America in 1988, he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller.  It stars Harrison Ford in a rather unique role; that of a doctor, an every man type such as Jimmy Stewart in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" without the Indiana Jones hype.  Although filmed 18 years ago, it seems more contemporary that ever.  A fine thriller that even Hitch would approve!

What is NOT contemporary is the fact that we consumers here in Region 1 - North America, that's right, Canada too, get nothing but JUNK  and  GARBAGE from the releasing studios.  Lousy, grainy transfers in the edited Pan  and  Scan format; not fit for anything but a 7"" DVD personal viewer, MAYBE!  Why is this and most any other post-1953 movie presented in it's original aspect ratio available in Region 2 - Europe but not on this side of the pond?  Disney is by far the major offender in this area but hey, what say you Warner Bros.?

It was always thought that the mighty oceans would protect us from our enemies, both foreign and domestic.  9/11 proved that wrong, and I guess nobody though of Hollywood as a band of American Home Video terrorists, a silly statement but ever so true!

509,"	Loose Cannon
 	The documentary was really, really good.  They left some stuff out of it, of course, but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense.  One thing I did not remember was the prodigious mullet Brian sported back in the day.  Man, I think that thing was more impressive than Jagr's Cup-winning mullet of the early-90s!
 
I don't know that I learned anything new from the documentary, but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing.  Also, Stone Cold talking about the Hollywood Blonds tag team was great fun. 
 
They really played up the Flyin' Brian stuff as being ahead of it's time (which it was) and the Loose Cannon character that had everyone guessing.  Funny thing is that the whole Loose Cannon thing wasn't really long-lasting if you think about it.  The gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his Humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill.
 
The accident was glossed over--he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed--but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not.  He knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him.
 
Anyhoo, the official coroner's report was that he had a heart attack; just as his dad had at a young age. Of course, the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over.  I mean, the WWE is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a (ahem) ""sports entertainer"" is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job.  It's the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale.  The truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him, he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in.
 
Best parts were reliving the Hollywood Blonds stuff.  I remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and Steve were going to be huge stars.  Steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in WCW.  They never name the booker but I am 90% sure that it was Ric Flair back then who headed the booking committee.  I am also 80% sure that Arn was on the committee too.  They must have felt threatened by the Flare For The Old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a TBS special in (I am guessing) 1992 or 1993.  Great stuff though; and Brian came up with the whole gimmick.  They were so hilarious together.
 
Another great part was Jim Ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to Brian in the WWF.  That was sad stuff.  JR really had a hard time trying to help Brian but Pillman only saw the fact that JR order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal.
 
Overall, I am going with 4 crutches out of 5.  I haven't watched any of the matches as yet but I am less interested in that kind of thing than I am the documentaries.

Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are excellent actors together and without them I don't believe the movie would have been the same. This classic ""fairy tale"" movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest. This is not your typical romantic movie and I believe that is why so many people love this movie. Pretty Woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there.

      The 15th Anniversary Special Edition also brought some never-before-seen scenes, deleted scenes, and commentary. The deleted scenes are also a must watch, they are just simply hilarious, and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies, but who also likes added comedy as well. Pretty Woman is definitely one of the greatest films ever made.

520,"	watch out for that tornado!
 	Over the years, people have grown tired of natural disaster movies.  Why?  Because they all appear to be the same.  Here's an example of a typical storyline- everything starts out nice and calm, the story focuses on one family, the family starts having problems and they split up, and then a volcano, tornado, hurricane, or whatever hits, and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger JUST so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie.  

Well, that kind of typical storyline isn't featured here.  Twister is truly a classic.  It's not ordinary, either.  It's about a group of tornado chasers who, as you guessed, drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get never-before-seen film of a twister, up close and personal.  

This means the film delivers the most amazing action I have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie.  Twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films, and I remember in 1996 how influential this movie was.  I was in 9th grade, and the science teacher played Twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was SO good and much better than other tornado films.  

Helen Hunt plays a magnificent role.  She is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she's going through.  What's great about this is that, despite giving us a really good story about a divorce, this doesn't interfere with all the tornado action.  There are *so* many good scenes in Twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie.

Favorite scenes?  Well, everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air, so I won't pick that one.  I really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater, tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it.  That's just one of MANY awesome scenes.  

The storyline is really good too.  It's not just a story about a divorce between Helen and her husband.  There's a lot more to it than that.  It's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action (against her will).  

This is such an awesome movie.  I highly recommend it.  Tornado movies don't GET any better than this.  Pure action from beginning to end.  You will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger.  Twister will make you think twice if you're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser.

521,"	More of a supernatural drama/thriller than a horror flick, but worth checking out.
 	Personally, I really enjoyed Premonition. It's got solid acting, a fascinating (and often heart-wrenching) story, and some decent scares.  However, don't expect an all out fright fest or you'll be sorely disappointed. This is a story-driven film, with a plot that progresses fairly slowly. Patience is necessary when viewing Premonition, as is a willingness to accept ambiguity and dream-like logic in a film. But for those of you who possess those qualities, and are looking for something a little different (particularly if you're a fan of the genre), Premonition might be for you

523,"	Reiner's Masterpiece.  For the old days.......
 	Setting  and  Theme(s): Castlerock, smallville, summer friends' adventure, life's lessons, solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown.  

This 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film.  The musical score is dramatic, it sets the tempo from start to finish, and it never misses a beat; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie's unfolding, and you don't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding.  The lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient, lazy summer days of grandeur, to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity.  One can in Stand By Me favorably assume to watch: pie eating contests, leeches, trains, train dodging, mail ball, fancy cars, fancy footwork (i.e. Verno's beloved comb's freefall), cantenes (thought they disappeared w/ Ben Franklin's outlets), junkyard dog chases, and much much more.  The ending is the real gravy.  The narration is superb also.  

By far one of the favorite films of my youth.  Believe John Cusack can be seen playing the role of Gordy's football star elder brother?  Stand By Me is the childhood that big city life just doesn't afford, at least not anymore.  Everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses; rustic destination spots, like the ones presented in this movie, are still out there folks.  With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure, which will take your there, the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated.  Although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors. 

Five stars for Reiners finest photoplay.

But Half Light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense:  there are some scares, but at the most tepid edge of today's horror.  The movie is much more about the grief of a mother (have the Kleenex box close by), and has a big love story (with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse; ugh) in the middle of it.  Just the kind of thing my wife might like, when she's willing to see something on her scary side.  Unfortunately for me, this is not my kind of movie at all.  

Even so, it was well made.  It was well acted.  The English locations were impressively beautiful.  The story was interesting, and had a good plot twist at the end.  Ah what the heck; I guess I liked it after all

530,"	CSI Miami reaches a high point with Season 3: Sun, Glamour, and Overacting Galore!
 	CSI:Miami, having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons, reaches its high point in Season 3. Anyone who has watched the show realizes that Horatio, unlike Gil Grissom or Mac Taylor, is the true star of the show. The rest of the CSIs are entertaining, but the show is truly about him. This dynamic, when combined with the glamour and glitz of the Miami setting and crimes most foul, make this for me the CSI that is above the rest.

Plotwise, season 3 is bit over the top. Issues covered in this season include a stalker murder, a sports star on trial for his wife's murder, a young woman killed in a club, the murder of a uniformed cop, gang warfare in a hospital, the killings of IRS agents, speed dating that ends in a death, spree killing, and the murder of a wingwoman. Some of the lesser episodes involve our old friend Clavo Cruz, a giant boa contricter that eats a woman, skaters and gamers, and of course, the infamous tsunami episode. The season incorporates the Raymond Caine subplot heavily in the last 5 or 6 episodes. This leads up to a satisfying conclusion in the season finale.

The season is also one of change. A regular cast member gets killed in episode 1, which quite frankly, was quite a relief since the character was terrible. Another regular, not a CSI, kills himself. A new cast member joins, Officer Ryan Wolfe, makes the transfer from patrol to CSI, and making some waves in the process. Callie and Delco (who has very little to do this season) have a tough time dealing with tragedy, and we actually see Horatio dating a rather attractive Assistant DA, at least for a few episodes. Some old familiars pop by, including Suzy and Madison, and Raymond Caine's killer Bob, who ends up being much more important in the story than we assumed. All in all it adds up to a great season, which will be extremely difficult to top in Season 4.

People either love or hate this show, so if you count yourself among the fans, this is a must addition to the collection.

He chases an albino wino who runs out of a convenience store with his Jack Daniels into a vacant warehouse.  Hayden falls through a second-story floor and hits his head which starts him receiving psychic visions of the victims through the eyes of the killer.  He meets a parapsychologist, Dr. Vera Swann, played by Polly Walker.  Romantic sparks eventually fly between the two, allowing Hayden to start to get over his divorce.  He lost his wife to police detective John Hatter played by Gary Hudson who seems to meddle in the investigation, eventually pointing toward his guilt.  Henry Czerny who was the thief opposite Harrison Ford in ""Clear  and  Present Danger"" and has done ""Pink Panther"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" plays Harvey, a psychic that attaches himself to Mickey Hayden in a gay bar.  Hayden frequents the gay bar because it's a place for a straight guy to be alone.

This DVD also includes the full-length videos of ""Bad"" and ""Thriller,"" which do not make ""Remember the Time"" forget with its amazing dance moves and catchy rhythms. This DVD compilation shows why Michael Jackson will always remain the king of pop. I like this DVD from all Michael Jackson DVDs. ""Don't stop until you've had enough"" and ""Rock with you"" may be simple videos, but I watch both videos and see Michael as innocent before the thriller. That's the best of Michael Jackson. Sony has done an incredible job on the sound quality of this Michael Jackson DVD. The sound quality of a normal TV or theatre system will surprise you"

We are shown how the echoes of events that occured nearly a century ago still resonate with deafening clarity in our twenty-first century lives. The mistakes which plunged the world into a decades long bloodbath are laid out in a way that describes, in riveting detail, the follies and grave consequenses of cavalier militarism.

541,"	A WINNING ELECTION
 	Rarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence, teenage angst, sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from Alexander Payne.  Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range.  Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon's often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality.  In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty.  One of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election.  Reese prays to an unfamiliar God and beseeches him to let her win so she ""can carry out his divine plan.""  Campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the Catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to, while goofy Klein shows the most depth by thanking God for all of his blessings (especially his large penis) and telling God he knows the best candidate will win.

 	The film shows us the reality that is Wal-Mart, many common criticisms, and many common misconceptions.  It successfully shows that all of the criticisms against Wal-Mart are outright lies, half-truths, distortions of facts, or just plain ideological hatred for a successful business.  It shows what the employees go through while on the job and off the job.  It also shows how Wal-Mart has actually increased America's standard-of-living by allowing the poorest of us to purchase our daily necessities at the lowest price possible and the least-skilled amongst us able to attain high-quality health benefits and a decent wage.

Wal-Mart is not a perfect business, and it never will be.  No business is perfect.  Unfortunately, many people do not ever cope with this fact, and don't seem capable of it.  They compare Wal-Mart to the ""perfect"" business which does not exist, and then have the audacity to complain when Wal-Mart does not fit their non-existant model of perfection

Utah native Eugene Nielsen, private first class in the 59th Coast Artillery, was one of the few who escaped. Filipino guerrillas transported the survivors to the island of Morotai, where Nielsen described his experience to an Army intelligence officer.

546,"	I Thought It Was Brilliant
 	""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True"" is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original Cinderella and a few new ones. The animation is amazing --- it's filled with lush color (except for muted color when the story calls for it) and the animation looks very polished. It's really a sight to see.

The three stories in this are called, according to the closing credits --- ""Aim To Please,"" ""Tall Tail"" and ""An Uncommon Romance."" These stories are all tied together with the idea that the Fairy Godmother is helping the mice to make a storybook about the adventures of them and Cinderella since the time that Cinderella met the Prince. The very first story finds Cinderella arriving at the castle after her honeymoon. The Prince is forced to rush away on important state business and Cinderella is left in charge of the royal banquet/ball. She has no idea what she's supposed to do and so this woman named Prudence is assigned to help her out. But will Cinderella be able to pull this together in time and in a way that will please the King?

The second story, ""A Tall Tail"" finds Cinderella in preparation for the Spring Festival. Jaq wants to help out, but it seems like Cinderella no longer has any time for him. He makes a wish to become human.

The final story contains the surprising premise that Cinderella's stepsister Anastasia is falling in love with a breadmaker at market. The Evil Stepmother forbids this romance, but Cinderella decides to show Anastasia that even she can have a dream come true.


The voice talent is amazing. They did a great job of casting people who made the voices sound just like the original film. Unless you're really listening hard, you'll be hard-put to notice any difference at all.

The music in this film is a combination of themes from the original and a few new songs performed by Brooke Allison. I'd never heard anything by Brooke Allison before (that I know of), but she's an amazing artist. Perhaps the most surprising piece is the closing credits number (also featured as a music video) --- a techno version of ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" called ""Put it Together."" It works quite well. Another great song is ""Follow Your Heart.""


For a Disney sequel, this DVD also has some nice special features. There's the aforementioned music video, which features entirely of clips from the film, rather than the recording session by Brooke Allison. However, you do get to see some of the recording in the Musical Magical Featurette, which also includes an examination of the film's score by the composer. There's a Cinderella Storybook, which allows you to read a story about Jaq and Mary with or without narration. The Enchanted Castle game is fairly simple, but not too bad --- you get to help with the decoration and cleanup of Cinderella's castle, preparing a meal and dressing Cinderella. There's also a DVD-ROM game called Cinderella's Dollhouse. Finally, of course, this DVD has the usual previews/trailers for other movies, but perhaps not so usual. This is a great set of trailers. There's a promo for the ""Beauty and the Beast"" Special Edition DVD in which they talk about how they inserted ""Human Again"" into the film. Also including in this set is a neat Disney DVD ""Pure Digital Magic"" promo that I had never seen before.

This DVD is truly a worthy edition to the Disney Cinderella story. It really has everything you could want from a sequel to this film and doesn't ruin the original story in any way

550,"	One of my favorites
 	What I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn't exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can't be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is ""I can't teach him how to be a man, that's your job."" How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne's charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, ""I know you think I'm being hard on you Tre, but I'm not. What I'm trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don't have anyone to do that, your'e gonna see how they end up, too."" I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I'd have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre's mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how ""real"" Furious was. ""Young"" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it's success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today.

551,"	Sleazy, But Very Entertaining: Nice Widescreen DVD
 	A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a ""ripoff"") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tapes).

The downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). 

The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies.

There is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women.

It's a satire, released in 1964 that still works and is watched by many people today. Whenever you look at a list of great movies, it's on there.

The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#3), is featured in Roger Ebert's ""The Great Movies,"" and is just, overall, acknowledged as a fine piece of cinema. The movie opens with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) launching an unauthorized nuclear attack against Russia. The general is clearly mad and believes that the Russians are polluting everyone's valuable bodily fluids. The only person who can stop Ripper is Captain Mandrake (Peter Sellers), a British guy who listens to Ripper's ranting in disbelief. Meanwhile, at The Pentagon, the President of the United States; President Muffley (Peter Sellers, again) assembles a meeting in the War Room where he is told hesitantly by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) that the bombers can not be recalled, no one can reach Ripper, etc. In one of the most hilarious characters I've ever seen portrayed on screen, we meet Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers, yet again) a strategist aiding the people in the War Room. Strangelove's right hand, covered in a black glove, has a mind of its own...It frequently throws up Nazi salutes and tries to kill Strangelove. Also happening in the story is one of the planes heading to Russia to drop the bomb. The ruler of the cockpit is Major ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens), a character that was supposed to be played by Sellers but reportedly couldn't because Sellers had recently suffered a broken angle. The scene where Kong rides a nuclear bomb as if he was riding a bull is one of the scenes in the movie that you're not likely to forget. Now, this is a funny and important film; But it's not my favorite Kubrick film, nor is it the most entertaining Kubrick film.

553,"	Not Just a Courtroom Drama-Micro-spective of the Human Condition..Must SEE!!
 	This black and white masterwork of film is a must see for all.  This is a not just a courtroom movie, but an examination of ourselves and how we see each other. Reginald Rose's original play reads like a powerhouse, even in a highschool english class, but given the direction of Sidney Lumet, the dynamite cast and the beautifully stark black and white cinematography it becomes a legend on film.

This movie centers on the diverse jury and it's deliberations in the murder trial of a young Puerto Rican man accused of killing his own father. It is an examination of our perception of one another, our selfish nature, our apathy when a crisis occurs-but does not affect us and our preconceived ideas of each other NOT based not upon fact, but upon our own experiences and traumas. It sheds light on how we process our decisions and how we can be easily yet unknowingly swayed away from the truth and yet believe we make honest and fair evaluations of fact, when in all truth we do not.

This was the ONLY film in which Henry Fonda starred AND was the producer and it was slow to take off at the box office. But within a few years this film became an american film mainstay. Regardless of the stunning performances and positive reviews, he never produced again.

This film has many of the early television and film greats and  each gives a RIVETING PERFORMANCE!!! There's Jack Klugman, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall and Lee J. Cobb who gives one of the most memorable performances in the film. Cobb, who was known for his moving portrayal of Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman, is aggravating and compelling. Fonda depicts the ""voice of reason"" juror that is neither self-righteous or bleeding-heart wimpy. He challenges the other jurors and the viewer alike to rethink their conclusions and recalculate them by utilizing ALL the facts. Anyone that sees this movie will recognize at least someone they know that is like each juror, which are designated only by number throughout it's entirety, in their daily lives.

Don't let the black and white format sway you, this DVD is presented in a lovely widescreen format that intensifies the expert cinematic talents of the golden age of the silver screen. This is considered an essential for anyone that loves film. My thirteen year old actually sat mesmerized through the whole film and began to watch some of my other DVDs (To Kill a Mockingbird, Inherit the Wind, Judgement At Nuremburg, to name a few) and at that tender young age, he is determined to spread the word and keep the tradition of sharing these movies of great distinction..

557,"	Munich, 1943, Last Six Days of Sophie Scholl, 21 Years Old
 	`Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage' (`Sophie Scholl - The Final Days') follows the last six days of the life of Sophie Scholl, member of `The White Rose' small anti-Nazi organization that protested against Hitler through the non-violence method in the war-time Munich. Her life had been filmed in Germany twice before - `The White Rose' by Michael Verhoeven, and `The Five Last Days' by Percy Adlon both in 1982. Unfortunately I haven't seen them, but the fact proves that this anti-war organization during the WWII in Germany, some part of which still remain mystery, has been always a very fascinating topic in that country.

Now, using the unpublished materials that were unavailable then, German director Marc Rothemund made another film based on this important episode in the German history. This time he gives stress to the realistic description of the last six days of Sophie Scholl, a 21-year-old college student who was arrested with her brother during the political activities against the Nazi in 1943.

Actually Sophie was only posting and scattering the anti-Hitler fliers in college campus, but that was enough for the Nazi; at first, however, they were not sure. Sophie is just an ordinary student, and the Nazi interrogator Robert Mohr was not convinced.

The film spends considerable time in depicting the dialogues between Sophie Scholl and Robert Mohr, and the rising tension between two real-life characters, supported by historical material and strong acting, is one of the most impressive parts of the film. Consequently the film becomes a bit talky sometimes, but both Julia Jentsch (`The Edukators') and Gerald Alexander Held did a fantastic job as two realistic persons with souls, without making them too saintly or monstrous.

If you're looking for the facts about The White Rose itself, you may be disappointed. The behaviors of Sophie and Hans, her brother, before their arrest by the police look incredibly reckless, far from that of organized resistance. The film would not tell you much about what the group was really doing before they were caught because it is about the spiritual transformation of Sophie Scholl. I don't know anything about the historical accuracy of the film, but it is clear that the filmmakers took great care to present the most accurate portrait of Sophie Scholl (see the detailed procedures of the court, for example). Because of that, the film sometimes gets slower than it should be, but still the powerful acting from the actors are as fascinating as this historical event itself.

But the strongest, or I should say, the most shocking part of the film is waiting for you at the end of the film. One image still haunts my mind, which I can't tell you of course, but all I can say is, prepare for one sequence that is more unnerving and disturbing any suspense or horror films.

Like `Downfall' another gripping German film about the Nazi, `Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage' gives you a realistic image of a human during the war. And this is a heart-wrenching story about one real-life person that lived an extraordinary life.

 	I'm not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force.

There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - ""takers"" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don't know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it.

The film has the location of both side's missile installations and both sides want it. Neither side will give an inch.

The chase takes place with a US nuclear sub, overcrowded by marines and spies. The problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission. The twists and turns don't stop and neither does the excitement. The film is dated but still a good show. The photography especially is spectacular, especially for that day and age.

570,"	Be Cool is entertaining but not memorable.
 	Before I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. It's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments.

However, the film is a bit uneven. The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his ""negotiation skills,"" he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.

An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. Andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.

F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it.

(Yeah! I wrote those words! Not another critic yet it's a true analysis of this fantastic film!)
   If you loved Richard Donner's LADYHAWKE then TIMELINE (2003) based on the novel by Michael Crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely! Modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor. ON the way and IN the way are knights of not so good caliber, ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there!
   My rating of TIMELINE is FIVE STARS! I can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you, the viewer to truly enjoy it, I'm not! When I saw TIMELINE for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful DONNER PRODUCTION and Billy Connolly, a Scot to whom my heart had been lost.

As ""Creedy"" in REIGN OF FIRE I'd fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that I'd gone to cheer on in the film. ""Creedy's"" torched demise gave me cause to end their existence. ""Marek"" is yet another character such as LADYHAWKES ""Navarre."" (Rutger Hauer) For ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man's man, ""Marek"" is your fellow!
   TIMELINE is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to ""back to the future!"" This is one film not only well worth the money but well worth the time to view over again and again! For ladies who despair of a real man keep this one within hand's grasp at a moment's notice! :-)

Also, while most BBC productions of literary masterpieces are studies in social conservatism this one obviously identifies with and invites us to identify with its most irreverent and forward-thinking characters: in this case the sultry and sophisticated, and somewhat libertine (in a 1920's kind of way), Lady Chatterly  and  the earthy and irreverent and smoldering (smoldering both with class resentment and with lust for a lady from the oppressive class) Oliver Mellors.  Both of these factors can be attributed to director Ken Russell who has had a long and illustrious career writing and directing some of the BBC's best programs (many of them about musical composers). Russell is nothing if not unconventional and freethinking. Of course most of us in the states know Ken Russell as the director of a handful of cult classics such as TOMMY (1975), ALTERED STATES (1979),and, GOTHIC (1986); all of which feature lurid dream sequences and, some would say, gratuitously lewd situations. But Ken Russell is actually a director with many facets, and Russell's interest in DH Lawrence goes back to at least 1969 when he made what is still the best DH Lawrence adaptation on film, WOMEN IN LOVE (starring Glenda Jackson, Oliver Reed  and  Alan Bates). He then followed that up twenties years later with THE RAINBOW (starring Amanda Donohoe, and Sammie Davis). Both of these adaptations are known for being restrained and fairly true to their sources even though Russell did add some scenes in both which were not in the original books; his additions, however, were tasteful and even added clarity to the material. 

What is interesting about this new DH Lawrence adaptation is that Ken Russell seems to have remained interested in DH Lawrence for so many years and for many of the same reasons. DH Lawrence more than any other author in the English language, or any language for that matter, stands for the power of the body and the bodies experience over the power of reason. This was the main theme of his earlier DH Lawrence adaptations and this is the main theme of his latest. But this one is by far the most sensual of the three and that is largely due to the fact that Joely Richardson seems to be the very embodiment of sensual awakening; the actress seems as willing as her character to simply follow the dictates of the body regardless of social norms.  Its always a big deal when a high profile actress (especially one with the lineage of Joely Richardson) sheds her clothes on screen, but to do so on British televison for all to see takes more than a little boldness. The nudity is well done and adds to the allure of this BBC classic; no question about that. The greatest scene in the entire 4 hour miniseries is not the nudity, however, but, the vision Joely has before she ever ventures out to that hut in the woods. One night after hearing her blowhard husband, Lord Clifford  (who cares more for his family estate ""Wragby"" and his ""class"" than he does about any individual), read from Socrates about the white horse of reason and the black horse of desire, she dreams she is riding through a Greek temple full of nude men who seem to be growing like vines out of the stone. This is not something that DH Lawrence ever wrote, this is pure Ken Russell and yet its the most exciting thing in the whole miniseries; plus its the best way to deliver Lady Chatterly's state of mind (or body) to us. DH Lawrence is actually very wordy for one who claims to be interested in the body more than in the mind but Ken Russell has found a visual shorthand for delivering those Lawrentian themes with nice visuals. I only wish there were more moments like this. The most sensual acting is done by Joely Richarson when in her private chambers. And Russell seems to be keenly aware that it is Lady Chatterly's imagination that fires her body. After the horse dream Connie drapes a veil over her head and walks nude through the house down to Lord Clifford's first-floor room. This scene is more imaginatively and erotically charged than any of the actual love scenes that will follow.  

The actual affair between Lady Chatterly and Oliver Mellors is a little odd; in fact its very awkward. At first they just agree (sort of) to use each other for sex. But of course that never works and soon they are intimates thoroughly engaged with each other, body and mind, and running naked through the rainy glades and meadows; then sitting nake dbefore a fire and pretending to be Lady Jane and John Thomas. Their ""understanding"" involves a mutual appreciation of nature, and a mutual loathing of Lord Clifford and the upper-class privileges that he defends as birthrights. Russell gets a lot of mileage out of the Racine and Proust reading and piano and chess playing Lord Clifford and his antagonisms toward all those that he perceives to be lower than himself (pretty much everyone in the coal mining community that he owns; this actor really has fun with this role and Russell obviously enjoys his rants because he gives him so many). Lord Clifford is actually a pretty forward-thinking guy, in his own way, as he does give his wife permission to take a lover, but, arguably, its for selfish reasons: he merely wants an heir. We certainly pity this WWI vet who must cart himself around in various malfunctioning contraptions (metaphors for the mind and its futile tinkerings perhaps; what people are reduced to when they no longer have a functioning body) but he just won't allow anyone to actually like him except his live-in nurse who finds him curiously attractive (a plot thread that Russell leaves undeveloped). He even vents about the lower classes ""knowing their place"" in the ""natural"" scheme of things right in front of his house servants. Russell lingers on the face of one table servant as he does so (another striking Russell touch). No mistaking whose side this film maker is on. So this affair of the body between Lady Chatterly and Mellors is actually informed by a social awareness and a mutual understanding and empathy (which one could argue is as much about reason as it is about the body). In any event we eventually come to accept that these two opposties are drawn to one another for a variety of social and sexual reasons: the one perhaps fueling the other. 

Lady Chatterly's own father and sister are free-living  bohemians; so why exactly she was attracted to the repressed snob Lord Clifford Chatterly is a bit of a mystery. Both her father and sister encourage Connie to find lovers but her sister anyway is as much as a snob as Lord Clifford. We're not certain and we never hear what her father thinks of her affair with the gamekeeper Mellors so we never know if the affair has had social repercussions for Lady Chatterly herself.  

The ending is a bit ...well I don't want to give it away. Suffice it to say that it's different than the book and it doesn't quite resolve those class issues that it raised. The answer seems to be: leave England. Perhaps the ending is based on one of Lawrence's short stories. In any event Ken Russell's creative attitude toward the ""classics"" is perhaps the most attractive thing about this adaptation. I hope his attitude is contagious and will inspire more loose and free treatments of the classics. This cultural freedom is refreshing and liberating (for mind and body).

 	Sure, I could have compared Phantom Quest Corp. to a lot of other animes out there, but the basic premise is the same -- we get a group of people who are working together to solve sci-fi mysteries...and there is definitely nothing wrong with that.
A friend of mine introduced me to this series, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised overall.
If you love having vampires and mummies, among other things, show up in your anime, along with a HUGE dosage of humor to boot, then you will absolutely LOVE this show -- it manages to take dark subject matter and make it into something comical.
I think the biggest weakness in this series is definitely a coherent side story -- it seems like things are a little too hashed together at times, and a little too rushed. On top of that, half of the Phantom Quest team only shows up when actually needed to do something, such as the team exorcist and the fortune teller -- neither of these two characters really gets a strong introduction at all.
One more weakness would really be in the music as well, which I found continuously grating on my nerves -- mainly, the theme song. Most of the other music is just merely OK.

Complaints aside, this is definitely worth your time, especially for such a small price -- buy this one, you certainly won't regret it

582,"	Moore's best film, before he became a political celebrity...
 	I really liked this film.  Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker.  This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today.  You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors.  I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest.  It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World.  It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time.  Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year).  Moore in recent years has become a ""political celebrity"", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America.  It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too.  They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows.  A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods.  I don't know if Moore is like that or not.  But this is still a potent, darkly funny film about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working class in America.

587,"	Agonized Poetry Visualized Exquisitely
 	Frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end; so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound.  This is due to its subject, its star, and its director, Julie Taymor, who also gave us the astounding Titus.  (If you have not yet seen Titus, do so before finishing this review - it is an art director's tour de force on a par with Brazil.)

Regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum, one can't help but be intrigued by the fascinating, and certainly unconventional, people of Frida.  Diego Rivera, played superbly by Alfred Molina, boasted the traditional faults of great artists, (narcissism, thoughtless cruelty, obsessive egotism), while showcasing some exceptional ones, (art as propaganda device, naive political idealism).  His flaws were as large as his murals, but he was never dull.

In addition to starring as Frida, Salma Hayek co-produced the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made.  How wonderful that she did.  Hayek has traveled under a Hollywood curse, appearing in one dreadful picture after another.  This is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by, and her performance is note perfect.  The story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy, but Hayek never lets that happen.  Her Frida is heart and steel all at once - amazing.

The take home message, if there is one, is that great art is never free.  In the case of Rivera, others paid the price; he fed off others like a greedy child.  In the case of Frida Kahlo, she herself paid the price, digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave.  There are moments of magic realism in Frida, where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa - if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were, astounding autobiographical statements.

There are a few missteps.  The liaisons with Trotsky and Josephine Baker feel almost obligatory, as if a form is being filled out.  But blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments, for example, when Rivera's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in Mexico.

Beyond highly recommended - must viewing.

589,"	The Facts of 9/11 ""Propaganda"" only to Enemies of Good
 	Of all the many many documentaries recounting the despicable acts of mass murder committed in the name of Allah on that day, this is by far the most comprehensive and the most unflinching.  Because of this, those whose mindsets side more with that of the terrorists will find this factual documentary somewhat distressing in its raw recitation of events.  And perhaps none more so than ""Caesar"" in his review of Sept. 17, 2006.  If only he found at least as troubling the carnage, bloodshed, and destruction deliberately perpetrated by his Islamic buddies against civilian populations.  But, more on this in a bit.  

As regards this extraordinary video, from the perspectives of air traffic controllers, FAA officials, NORAD and NEADS, the air crews and passengers on board each of the four doomed flights, to the testimonies of the witnesses, participants, firefighters, and all the heroes on and near Ground Zero, this is the singular documentary that takes you minute by minute through the hell deliberately planned and perpetrated by those whose religion had them believing that the execution of such hellish bloodshed granted them virgin-laden heaven.  (and no... this is not the ""propaganda"" or view of the documentary, but instead my own conclusions drawn on many years of personal investigation of Islam).

Anyone who, like ""Caesar"" here, could watch this fully factual account and then call such a splendid documentary ""goody-goody propaganda"" ""try(ing) to portray the US as good guys being hit by the bad guys..."" reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own anti-American hatred for so apparently condoning such ghastly blood-soaked horrors as the acts of ""good guys"" retaliating against ""bad guys.""  

While ""Caesar"" (how telling a nickname) attempts to school us ignorant Americans on our country's past political-policy foibles, yet he fails to mention the billions in financial and economic aid we have given the Islamic nations, the millions in military equipment and technical advisory assistance provided them as they struggled against invading Soviet forces and/or other foreign enemies attempting to annex and rule over sovereign Islamic nations, the ousting from Kuwait of the brutal armed forces of an Islamic fascist dictator who had invaded and then ""enjoyed"" weeks of the metaphoric and all too literal raping in this tiny Islamic nation while openly looting, terrorizing, butchering, torturing, and murdering its citizens while none of its Islamic neighbors lifted so much as a finger to intervene, but instead begged the United Nations and the U.S. to solve their problems for them... which we did!  And these are just a tiny listing of the far greater acts we have done for the cause of justice and good, and all of it on Islam's behalf.  And yet, 9/11 is only the latest and greatest terrorist massacre by which we continue to be repaid by the bloodthirsty religion of Islam for all we have done and continue to do on its behalf.

""Caesar"" also glaringly omits and all too conveniently ignores radical Islam's blood-soaked history and their on-going policy of religiously motivated bomb blasts, hijackings, kidnappings, tortures, rapes, gang rapes, female circumcisions, sawing and/or hacking off people's limbs and heads, mutilations, and always... mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide, including those of their own religion, and all thanks to Islam's foundational tenets of blood lust that makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable, eternally rewardable, and thus... forever inevitable.  

True, all religions have their radicals and fanatics.  But none deliberately attract, nurture, and encourage terrorist fanatics more than does Islam.  And none preaches genocide against the entire Jewish race/nation and all non-Islamic ""infidels"" in the name of God more than does Islam.  And it is how this video accurately documents for the entire world only this latest and greatest mass butchery in the name of Allah that probably motivates ""Caesar"" most to attempt such blatant anti-U.S. propagandizing here.  And for those who would disagree, I challenge ""Caesar"" or anyone else to provide us any reliable evidence of even a single factual error in this documentary. 

What I think ""Caesar"" fears most is that such a powerful documentary as this might add to the growing world view that despite the constant rhetoric of Islam as a religion of ""peace,"" the ever-escalating terrorist acts of its leaders and constituents in the name of Islamic religion reveal the exact opposite to be the true case.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking any religion that so encourages its hormone-driven young men to blow themselves up with as many ""infidels"" as they can so as to spend eternity in orgiastic sex with 72 virgins deserves to be fully prosecuted, at the very least on charges of ""conspiracy to commit (mass) murder""!

And one thought that just hit me:  If more and more Islamics continue to either commit or condone such bloodshed and with the full approval of their Islamic leaders, which god are they truly honoring and emulating:  Allah -- the Creator of Life; or instead, Iblis (Satan), the Destroyer of it?  By their fruits are they known, after all.

And on the question of whom and what Islamics most worship and adore, permit me to close this review as also does this wonderful documentary, by quoting one of Islam's most renowned clerics:

""We love death.  The U.S. loves Life.  That is the big difference between us.""    -- Osama bin Laden

Yet 11 September is only the latest and greatest terrorist massacre, with which we continue to be rewarded by the bloodthirsty religion of Islam for all we have done and continue to do in its name. ""Caesar"" also ignores and conveniently ignores the blood-soaked history of radical Islam and its continued policy of sectarian bombings, kidnappings, kidnappings, torture, rape, gang rapes, female circumcision, sawing and / or chopping off limbs and heads, mutilations and more and more... mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder, all committed worldwide, including those of their own religion, thanks to the fundamental teachings of bloodlust of Islam, which makes all these horrors not only acceptable but actually commendable, eternally worthwhile and therefore... forever inevitable. True, all religions have their radicals and fanatics. But no one is deliberately attracting, nurturing, and encouraging terror fanatics more than Islam. And no one preaches genocide against the entire Jewish race / nation and all non-Islamic ""infidels"" more in the name of God than Islam. And it is the way this video is being accurately documented for the whole world that it is only this latest and largest mass slaughter in the name of Allah ""Caesar"" that motivates the most to engage in such blatant anti-US propaganda here."

597,"	Still Quirky and Funny Black Comedy Tells the Ultimate Opposites-Attracts Love Story
 	This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.

The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with ""Foul Play"" and ""Nine to Five"") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.

Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in ""The Graduate"", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included

 	This presents us with a visual voyage into music that, in my opinion, excels that if the original Fantasia. Not only is the animation itself is extremely fluid, colorful, and highly diverse from segment to segment, but the representation of the music is, in itself, sheer genius. As I have come to expect from Disney, at least some research has been done into the texture of the music as well as thematical studies and tonal structure. This much, I believe, is made in evidence of both blatant and subtle use of contrast on screen to highlight the contrast of the music

599,"	Surpasses Silence Of The Lambs
 	I have to say, it took me a while to getting around to seeing this.  I thought ""Silence Of The Lambs"" was good - it featured a great performance by Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of it was....good.  But that was about it, as far as I was concerned.  It just didn't really click with me, and it wasn't anything near the great movie I'd been hoping for, so when its sequel was released I didn't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released.  A bit surprisingly though, I thought ""Hannibal"" was really great once I finally did see it.  Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than ""Silence..."" (which is fine by me) and it may have been, marginally.  But much more than that, it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor, and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie, in my opinion.  Hopkins is just as good, if not better, than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around, and while I usually don't like recasting roles in a movie (unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice, and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster.

   The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original, pre-incarceration, carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter.  It seems like ""Hannibal"" has changed tract from ""Silence"" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter's victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves.  Whether that's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible, the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who's even more evil than he is.  Hannibal Lecter himself is, well, he's not a 'good guy' in this movie; he is, though, presented in very cryptic shades of grey.  His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real, and he's much more interesting as a character this time around.  Clarice also is; she comes across here as a character who's somehow traumatized, perhaps even mentally unbalanced, deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it, and that's what so intrigued him in the first place.  One possible interpretation of things overall (and this is just one of many potential takes on it; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie-lovers) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had/has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil, while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal-level violence in her, but chose to be good, chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness.  A lot of food for thought in this one (no pun intended). 

   Great performances all around; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under-rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable, rather creepy FBI agent who's constantly at odds with Starling.  A very, very engaging and wel-made movie

 	Microphone {tap, tap, tap}: Ladies and gentlemen! For your wrestling entertainment, I introduce to you the Lord's Luchador, the Mauling Monk, the Orphanator! Put your hands together for Naaaacho Liiiibbbbre!

Jack Black (KING KONG) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess' latest cinematic offering, NACHO LIBRE. Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who's early dreams of becoming a luchador (wrestler) come to fruition later in life. 

Jack Black plays Nacho, a cook at an orphanage/monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily. But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler. His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera (LADIES NIGHT), and by a wily thief named Esqueleto (SUPERVIVENCIA), a streetwise thug with bizarre moves. Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring, only to be beaten time and again, but still making money. But making money isn't enough for Nacho (""I want to win!""). Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner, including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs. 

Finally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his ""inner"" strength to make his way to the top.

Silliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre, but it is saved by Jack Black's incredible physical comedy. Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast. The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental (Cow dung to the face? A wasps nest to the head? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow?) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion, the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt-muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion!

607,"	Fellini's Rome is Not Everyone's Rome
 	Federico Fellini's 1972 film is not his best, when he has 8 1/2, La Strada and La Dolce Vita to his credit. While many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless, dreamy structure, I found it boring and phantasmagorical. It is simply Fellini's version of Rome and not Rome, the Eternal City itself. To risk sounding negative, I shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970's Rome - the scenes in which the hippies and American tourists invade the city, the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off (though saying some pretty vulgar things) and my favorite scene- the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old Roman Patricians fade into oblivion. But mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot. It starts off alright, and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences. Fellini is himself in this movie, as well as Gore Vidal. Fellini envisions himself as a young man studying Rome in his youth in a strict Catholic school (the slide/projector shows ancient monuments like the Colliseum, the Apian Way, Trevi Fountain and Vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman's behind) and later as a young man journeys to Rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum. Then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless, vulgar and long-winded. I found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage! It bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution, brothels or cheap, slutty women. The cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film. And for a film about Rome and Italy, there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater. The Pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous. Only serious, hardcore fans of Fellini will want to own this DVD. It is a perfect follow-up to his equally absurd and sexually radical Satyricon, loosely based on the old Roman epic.

Yes, but unfortunately compared to volume 1, you can see that there are much less swordfights and basically no violence at all. Any swordfight that actually takes place usually does not last long enough to be considered a ""fight."" But this DVD makes up for that with much more comic antics than the first volume.

 	I didn't watch this one before
Because of all the hype
Too many buddy comedies
Were coming through the pipe

This one caught me by surprise
It really was first rate
Two dudes who're crashing weddings
So they'll always have a date

Fast-talking party animals
With very rigid rules
Break it off before sunrise
Commitment's just for fools

Until one day one falls in love
The other falls in lust
If you want to see Vince Vaughn get hurt
Then this one is a must

Sometimes sappy, sometimes sweet
and often lewd and loud
but it doesn't stoop to flatulence
so it stands out from the crowd

618,"	All teen movies should be this great
 	I love this movie. While the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film, ""She's All That"" doesn't go overboard and, surprisingly, presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata.

After Zach, the class president and soccer star, is very publically dumped by his ""magically delicious"" (and equally popular) girlfriend, Taylor, he's hard put to maintain his legacy.

Uber-jock, though a little slow, Zach's friend, Dean, bets him that he can't replace Taylor and make any girl prom queen.

Enter Laney Boggs, an art student who cares little about the social scene. Dean picks Laney as Zach's prom queen ""project"" and Zach has a hard time convincing Laney to even go out with him.

Meanwhile, Taylor, the ex, is dating a Real World reject who she met over spring break, but she's still catty over her ""discards"" and is horrible to Laney, embarassing her at a party.

The more time Zach spends with Laney, the more he starts to like her and Laney begins to open up and finds a real outlet in her art.

Dean, sensing he might be about to lose the bet, asks Laney to prom before Zach gets around to it and, a recently single Taylor, attaches herself to Zach's arm, assuming he'll take her back.

Ultimately, feelings are hurt, battle lines are drawn...and a really cool dance scence takes place at the prom.

I love the fresh comedy in the movie that is amusing for teens without being impractical or raunchy. The characters are well-developed and actually evolve in a realistic fashion (even if you are left wondering how nice-guy Zach ever dated self-absorbed Taylor Vaughn).

All-in-all, there's really nothing comparable to the teen movies like ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Pretty In Pink"" because those are genres unto themselves, but ""She's All That"" is definitely a nice representation of a good, modern teen movie

621,"	A Story Worth The Whole Nine Yards
 	If there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides ""Saving Private Ryan,"" this is it.

The story starts with a lawyer visiting England as a tourist years after war's end. He discovers a cheap, ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value. ""Value?"" replies the lawyer. ""Wrap it very carefully"" he adds. So begins his mental journey back in time to the English airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th (nine, eighteenth) Bomb Group.

This ""hard luck"" group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has ""over-identified"" with his men, thus putting them before his missions. The general, Frank Savage, must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit.

General Savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit. They turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind, or letting down their new leader. (Each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel piece in the Officers' Club, and turning the head of a ceramic pirate, face outward.)

But the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes. He will always keep the mission first, and will not over-identify with his men. He will not let the loss of his men affect him. 

Or, will he?

This black  and  white story is exceptional and superbly acted. It shows the mental tug-of-war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect. It depicts how the ugliness of war brings out the best in ourselves, and creates fraternal bonds that last a lifetime.

This is not a gory story, but it is one that will leave you breathless. It may sadden you, but it will not disappoint you. It does not end with everyone living, or happy.

War never does.




P.S. The ""whole nine yards"" refers to the length of ammunition linked together that fed into the machine guns aboard each bomber

He will not be swayed by the loss of his men. Or is it?"

 I also saw complaints about Leslie saying some silly things about the size of her nose, dusting the floor, etc; this is classic Leslie chatter, and I personally think it makes the workout go faster. If you don't like the chatter of her other videos, you wont like this one.

Great opener. Lots of high spots included. For 300+ pounders, 3 Minute Warning really can move. Surprise ending.

2) Cruiserweight Championship: Jamie Noble (champion) vs. Billy Kidman (5/5)
Both looked impressive during the match putting on a superb bout. Watch for Noble's sick DDT and Kidman aerial moveset.

3) Hardcore Match for Women's Championship: Trish Stratus (champion) vs. Victoria (4/5)
A solid women's division match. Tons of weapons but a weak finish. Victoria supposedly injured her ACL in this match but I couldn't find the spot. Maybe you can.

4) WWE Championship: Brock Lesnar (champion) vs. Big Show (2/5)
Of course Brock was able to suplex the Big Show and Brock was able to get him up for the F-5, which Paul Heyman doubted. The match unfolded quickly and equipped a strong end.

5) WWE Tag Team Championship Elimination Match: Edge  and  Rey Mysterio (champions) vs. Kurt Angle  and  Chris Benoit vs. Los Guerreros (3/5)
Using a Tag Title bout as a warm-down match didn't pay out well. Rey possessed an intense aereal arsenal compared to his present one. Worth watching.

6) World Championship Elimination Chamber Match: Triple H (champion) vs. Kane vs. Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Booker T vs. Shawn Michaels (4/5)
I was hoping someone would bring the match atop the chamber, but was disappointed. And the fact that Jericho was a World Tag Team champion at the time puzzled me, since Christian, his partner, wasn't even on the show. Besides that, a great Main Event. RVD nearly crushed Triple H's throat at one point. Jericho knew how to work an Elimination Chamber at perfectly.

 	SYBIL is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public.

Wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques, both the book and the movie became musts for students of Abnormal Psychology at that time and for decades afterwards.
Joanne Woodward reverses her roles from ""The Three Faces Of Eve"" to portray Dr. Cornelia Wilbur with consummate skill, while Sally Field's performance as Sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another (the movie works with thirteen of the Book's sixteen personalities).  Without being overtly graphic, the movie conveys all of the horrors of Sybil's childhood with an incredible impact.
The rest of the cast is excellent, with Martine Bartlett's ""Hattie"", Sybil's mother, in the chilling forefront and Natasha Ryan as Little Sybil close behind.
The real Sybil, unaware that Sally Field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with Joanne Woodward, let it be known that she wanted Stewart Stern and Daniel Petrie to try and get Sally for her part. {From the Extras Bonus Disk)

 	AN ANIMATED FAMILY OF X-MEN -- COMPLETE WITH SPANDEX  and  IT ALL TURNS OUT PRETTY - - WELL - - INCREDIBLE: 

Pixar and Disney have made six exceptional films together, but I find myself reaching for this one almost every time. 

Needless to say, superhero films are no longer novelties, yet this film seems to have new angles on seemingly cliched themes. The lawsuits that put the ""Supers"" out of business is certainly a real gem and it gives Brad Bird who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"" some unexplored avenues to try, which he does and it turned out, well - - PRETTY INCREDIBLE! 

WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: 

First we have the husband and wife superhero team that never has a chance to team up as ""Supers"" and instead turns into Mr.  and  Mrs. Average American after the lawsuits that ended the ""Supers"" crime fighting dynasty. Along the way they had three very different yet ""Super"" offspring! Wow, that's enough right there to keep us busy. 

We also have sub-plots which include each one of the 3 children's coming of age in a ""Super"" way, but as ordinary kids. The kids, like their parents, struggle all the way through the film to get to where they go and they grow in the process individually and as a family. 

We have Bob Parr [Mr. Incredible] going through what appears to be a mid-life crisis, and his confused wife, Helen, who just wants them all to fit in like everybody else. But, after all, how can ""Elastigirl"" be just another soccer mom? We have the return of a hostile and dysfunctional former fan [Buddy] who turns ""The Incredibles"" lives upside-down and inside-out. For the first time, the ""Supers"" are the underdogs! 

EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS - SATISFYING FAMILY ISSUES  and  MUCH MORE: 

After these elements are set into motion, we have EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWS, and it is fascinating to see all the Incredibles' family issues worked out like any other family's, but with many interesting twists. ""The Incredibles"" is a SUPER film! 

DVD FEATURES: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.39:1 [very widescreen] Digital to Digital Transfer is the sharpest I have seen yet! 

Lots of features and deleted scenes as well as some early concepts for different ways of introducing the characters make me grateful they made it the way they did. 

The ""Jack-Jack Attack"" is probably the high point of the features and illustrates what we did not see going on between ""Jack-Jack"" and the baby-sitter. I just wish it was longer. The behind the scenes ""Featurettes"" are worth watching as are the blooper scenes, though they seem a bit contrived. 

There are two commentary tracks, one with Brad Bird [writer/director] and John Walker [producer]. and another with the animators. I could not watch the entire movie with either track on. Maybe you can. The files about the ""Supers"" are interesting. There is lots more. If you like to go in for it, you can spend the day with the features alone. 

For me, however, there is the film. This is the best animated film, in my opinion, and is perfect for all members of the family (of all ages) to connect with in a fun-filled, family sort of way.

It's imaginative, as was ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", but goes beyond that movie with even better stop-action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving. I loved ""Nightmare"", but Corpse Bride takes all the things I loved and made them better. The voices of all the actors ring true. The mood is gothic and yet comical. The score is rich and defines the movie perfectly. (The DVD allows you to watch the movie with only the music, and that's a real plus.)

644,"	A Real Student of History - Pursuer
 	""Student of History"" is a student of Christian biased history. There are plenty of qualified scholars, and current book like that of theologian Bart Ehman for one, who show that early Christianity was based on forged documents that claimed earlier pedigree, but were written by ambitious men who sought to dominate a very wide spead of ideas about who and what those events in Judea were about. (Not Paliestine! The Romans named the region Palestine after the war against the Jews in 70CE). The fact that one man (Constantine) sought a single authoritive finality was a political move, not an act or miracle of ""God."" Authority of apostles is more Christian myth and power assertion, not historical proof of the varacity of the Bible and Christian claims. Objective scholarship has shown for example that a church father (probably Iraneus) forged copies of Josephus by adding the paragraphs that refer to Jesus. It is easy to understand when we remember that typewriters and copy machines did not exist then! Handwriting is sort of a give-away, especially when other earlier copies exist with no insets about Jesus. What is known about the Gospel of Thomas and other second century altnative Christian texts is that they were warred against by the eventual winner. It might have gone otherwise and then people like you would be claiming a completely different set of circumstances as facts. People with no authority like Iraneus wrote tracts condemning any other view than his own and those of his small cult. He called Arius of Alexander for example, a heretic. But he had no authority to do so. He forged documents to prove it never realizing that in the future, others would also forge whatever they found expedient to make reality for believers. Paul called it ""Lying to bring you the truth."" But a lie is a lie and historians can't make lies facts. So the yoke of bias due to conditioned belief must be thrown off if one is to be a true historian and seeker of truth.

The real ""key"" to the entire mystery - and the inspiration for all of these writers is the nagging reality of the original parchments found by the real life priest Beringer Saunier in 1891 in Rennes-le-Chateau. I have been there several times. The original parchments are kept in a vault in London at a Loyd's Bank. The copies have been studied by many and here is the problem for the debunkers; When a fraud is being perpetuated, code puzzles are invariably simple and unsophisticated. Experts agree that the codes on the parchments are so sophisticated that they would have had to have been created by a very intelligent individual - a genuis. Everything can be argued down for lack of enough solid evidence if you wish to prefer Christian myths like virgin birth, death and resurrection (actually earlier pagan myths), but the parchments remain a piece of evidence that no un objecive debunker likes to talk about. 

Dan Brown has made the subject popular again by writing a book and making a film that tantilizes the minds of many people. He also gives the public a new level of nonsense to wade through and a rich source of psuedo history for debunkers to feast upon, pretending to extend their claim to truth by turning over toys in a kindergarten class.

If you are going to claim to be a student of history, you must be objective and ready to accept what is there, not select what suits you. And if you want to answer the many very quesitonable claims of Chrisitanity and the claimed history of the faith, then you must be willing to question the premises. Once you do that, you will find that there is plenty to support doubt. Just knowing about the Catholic destruction of previous historic and relgious records along with anyone who opposed them, ought to clue the thinking person that something is up with tradtional Christian Western history on its face.

Dan Brown, and and to a greater extent, Leigh, Baigent and Lincoln have a lot more material than that planted and represented by Pierre Plantard. The discussion of the Biblical evidence itself is compelling without ever having Pierre Plantard at all. Why is there a large tradition of all people extant at the time that Simon of Cyrene was crucified, not Jesus? (Muslims claim this today and Christian Freemasons are aware of the source document- I have seen it myself). And if we really want to be factual about it, there never was a Jesus Christ in Judea. Paul created his church in Greece and the Hellenized region of Asia Minor. ""Jesus Christ"" is Greek. If there was a character that Jesus was based on his name would have been Josua ben Joseph and his brother ""James"" would be Jacob. If you dig in you will find no basis for a person named Jesus exists and the probability that the Jesus Christ character was only Paul's creation based on another person who was crucified as a rebel by the Romans and whose sect venerated his death as a memorial that became part of their sect of Judiasm.

One book of found in the Dead Sea Scrolls is the Book of Enoch. Freemasons have owned a copy of it and it is tracable to at least 1717 when the Grand Lodge in London announced itself. How does a book that only became known to the public when the closely guarded srolls were finally made public in the 1990s, already exist among a society of brotherhood that can be traced to the Knights Templar? This is not myth, but a sample of factual connections one can make if they objectively study the quesitons, culling out the fluff and theory from fact for 20 years as I have. 

I didn't just read, I traveled. It takes a long time to verify or debunk a historical claim or theory. These people who study the subject for a year and then write a book amuse me, but very well. I completely enjoyed the film, The Da Vinci Code, even though I could not read the book, because I knew too much of the where he got his ideas from to read it. Leigh Teaging= Richard Leigh, Teabing = Michael Baigent, and the GM of the Priory named Sauniere. There is a code for begginers in the book, but I am no beginner. Still, I found the film enjoyable and I even thought the book is a good thing, because I am a bit like the Leigh Teabing character in the Da Vinci Code. I believe that a lie even to build a faith is a lie and overall, the worse will come from it. Histoy shows that to be true. Religions are built on lies made for the purpose of power and control over others. What we witness now in the world is more of that with more and worse to come. It is probably useless, but only when people can know the real truth and throw off the superstition and neurosis of religion, including and especially Christianity (but all others as well) will the human race have a chance to become something besides a mass of ants bent of self destruction.

If there is any use for the historian, it must be to serve as a witness and a warning. How long will we repeat history? As long as we insist on institutionalizing lies and myth.

In the meantime, established Christian indluence and owned media produce airy debates quoting the Bible and it's own set of Biblical facts as ultimate fact because they haven't yet gone to the bottom of the scholarly bebate - and don't want to.

647,"	Everything you could ask for in an intelligent action thriller
 	I have no idea why I had never heard of this movie before because Ronin is a whale of a good film.  I can take or leave most action films, but give me a taut, intelligent, suspenseful thriller filled with great action, wicked twists, and some of the best car-chasing footage you'll ever see, and I'm happy.  Throw Jean Reno and the one and only Robert De Niro into the mix, as well, and I'm happier than any clam has a right to be.  Director John Frankenheimer obviously knows that action alone doesn't make for a good action film, and he also knows that the only way to make a high speed chase scene look authentic is to film a real high speed chase scene.

The title is derived from the term for masterless Samurai of feudal Japan - warriors who failed their master and were left to wander in the shame of their failure.  In modern parlance (and in this movie), the term applies to special agents of various governments who find themselves quite on their own thanks to the end of the Cold War.  These men still put their skills to good use by selling their services to those willing to pay them for handling sensitive, usually dirty, jobs.  In this case, Sam (De Niro), Vincent (Reno), and three others are brought together in France by an Irish lass named Deirdre and charged with acquiring a metal case well-protected by its current carrier.  It sounds easy - ambush the target and his security force, snatch the case, exchange it for cash, and move on.  Naturally, the mission turns out to be extremely complicated, as a couple of powerful parties want whatever is in that case, and a certain individual proves less than trustworthy.  What's the world coming to when you can't even trust a selfish, independent-minded, well-trained gun-for-hire?  De Niro has to run over and shoot up half of France before everything gets resolved in this film.

The only problem I had with this movie came in the form of the thick accents of some of the characters, especially the Irish ones - you may want to use closed captioning at times to really understand everything that is said.  The actors themselves, though, were quite good, especially De Niro and Reno, who make a great team.  As for the mix of bad guys, how about three - count 'em, three - former adversaries of James Bond (Michael Lonsdale, Sean Bean, and Jonathan Pryce)?  Not only that, the script is worthy of all these fine actors.  

As I've mentioned already, though, the chase scenes are really the most memorable aspect of this film.  Frankenheimer doesn't have any use for these fancy-schmancy new digital means for manufacturing this kind of action, instead treating the viewer to several good, old-fashioned thrill rides through the streets of Paris and its local environs.  Besides filming an incredible number of scenes live, he also chose to forego the accompaniment of a musical score in these situations, letting the revving engines, squealing brakes, and numerous crashes and explosions present the action as authentically as possible.  They had to have had an incredible number of stunt drivers and stunt men involved, as folks were constantly crashing or jumping out of the path of oncoming cars - not to mention the extended high speed chase down one-way streets into busy oncoming traffic.  I'm telling you - these chase scenes are flat-out impressive.  

Obviously, I think Ronin has it all.  Without De Niro, it still would have been a fantastic film; with him, it's a must-see in my book

648,"	A Feel Good Film With Interesting Psychological Conflict
 	""The Bells of St. Mary's"" was a shrewd move by Paramount Studios and director Leo McCarey, whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical Catholic priest Father O'Malley, ""Going My Way"", spawned the 1945 release, which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict.  Irish Catholic McCarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed ""Going My Way"" and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the Catholic world inhabited by Father O'Malley.

Bing Crosby had garnered a Best Actor Oscar for ""Going My Way"" and McCarey secured the services of the beautiful Ingrid Bergman to play Sister Benedict, the Mother Superior of St. Mary's School.  Crosby found himself immediately clashing with Bergman on certain points relating to the parish, but through it all a mutual respect existed between them.  Each realized that the other was committed to the best interests of St. Mary's.

Dudley Nichols, a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award winner a decade earlier for the John Ford film about the Irish political conflict starring Victor McLaglen, ""The Informer"", directed his effort in the script toward presenting Crosby and Bergman in periodic conflict, but learning from those experiences.  Much of the contrast, they realize, stems from the way that men and women view situations.  One phase of the film showing this difference is when Bergman teaches a young student who has been victimized by a bully how to box as a means of restoring order.  She feels a tinge of guilt since the youngster's failure to fight back and receipt of a beating in the process stemmed from his obedience to her stricture against fighting at St. Mary's.  

When Crosby pursues a conventional macho posture in extolling the need for protecting oneself and praises the fighting skills of the bully, the nun has had enough.  She purchases a boxing instructional book written by former heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and adeptly instructs the obedient youngster in the manly art of self-defense as he ultimately teaches the bully a lesson.  Crosby recognizes her teaching skill and becomes cognizant of the strength of her feminine viewpoint.

An area where Crosby and Bergman cooperate is in seeking the answer to the nun's fervent prayer.  She believes that of the mortgage holder of their property, Henry Travers, who has built a modern building next door and seeks to use the church property for an employee parking lot, may through prayer and proper persuasion be convinced to give them his modern structure.  The result would be a new school and no further need to use the tired current facility.

The effectiveness of Crosby and Bergman stems from their soft sell technique with just the right pinch of Christian charitable thought thrown into the mix.  Travers, who cannot sleep nights and experiences heart problems, confides to the priest and nun separately that he wishes he was better liked.  

Their soft sell approach in advancing the ""It is more blessed to give than to receive"" precept along with the accompanying feel good element of charity prompts Travers to see things in a light more favorable to the interests of St. Mary's.

Crosby and Bergman are delights to behold in this feel good film.  They provide challenges to each other through disagreement and an effective front when they team up on the issue of greatest importance to them, the welfare of St. Mary's parish.

 	How many times have you watched an exercise video hosted by a bouncy, perky blonde with a plastic smile making you feel like a fat, lazy slob? Or maybe it was an arrogant Hollywood trainer with that ""fitter than thou"" sneer... these instructors just don't seem like real people with real lives outside the gym, do they?

Well, Ana Caban is different. She has a warm, relaxed presence with grace borne of years of ballet. She explains the moves thoroughly without talking down to the viewer, and she gives the impression that she does Pilates because she likes the results - not because she is an obsessive-compulsive exercise fanatic. The exercises are geared toward the beginner, yet offer enough of a challenge to keep you busy for a while. When you've mastered the beginner workout, she also leads an intermediate workout which offers greater challenges, but the familiarity of Ana's friendly demeanor.

I have a hard time making myself exercise, but when it comes to buckling down and choosing something to do for myself, this is the DVD I pop in the machine. I've purchased several exercise tapes and DVD's over the years, but this one has definitely seen the most use

653,"	Not For Everyone
 	Witch Hunter Robin is a great series which I enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series. The visuals are first rate, the music (when there is music) is beautiful, and the storyline is intriguing. 

Silence and extended stares cloak the characters in mystery... so what's the problem? That same cloak covers the series in what could potentially be a series of yawns.

One of the major problems with Witch Hunter Robin is the pace. Many serious animes either take themselves too seriously or not seriously enough... WHR takes itself much too seriously. Surely the story and visuals are worth it but for some reason there are long, tiring sequences during the course of the series which are supposed to be ""meaningful."" 

They are I suppose in retrospect (one will notice this once they watch the final episodes of WHR), but the events in the series do not warrant such extended periods of self reflection on the part of the main character(s). The psychological and philosophical themes present are obvious toward the end of the series, and where they are not, the intelligent viewer can pretty much guess at them.

I realize that this exhausted review of WHR seems to only be about the tiresome pace at which the series progresses, but it's an important factor as it leaves many to simply drop the series half way before ever seeing the later episodes (the best episodes in my opinion).

A second problem is also the fact that there are a number of ""witch capturing"" which take place during the series that seem... well, silly. The beginning of the series is all about these capturing - surely after seeing the last couple of episodes the viewer begins to understand how this ties into rounding out the characters but during the course of the series this might just bore you to tears especially if a number of episodes feature witch/enemies that simply don't interest you (which they may not, the creativity and design behind many of them is poor to say the least).

In the end the series is about the characters, story, and visuals not the enemies which frequently populated much of the series - if you find yourself hooked on the main characters and their back-stories when they are introduced in the beginning of the series then you might like the whole thing.

Lastly as for reviewers that were expecting something ""scary,"" most of the shows on Adult Swim are for adults and the anime shows featured on Adult Swim are geared toward those typically interested in other things beside quick thrills (needless to say those watching the series probably aren't into it because the name of the series is ""Witch Hunter,"" they are instead - hopefully - looking for a high quality, cohesive action/drama anime). This is not for individuals wanting to watch an action anime however... it's more of a beautiful drama. Younger anime viewers are not bound to like this one at all!!!

I'd give it a try first renting it before you go out and spend money on it!

654,"	this is who we are... the time is near
 	Season 1 of ""Millennium"" featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made ""The X-Files"" look sunny by comparison. Unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a ""murder mystery of the week"" fare. Thankfully the second season, supervised by former ""X-Files"" producers Glen Morgan and James Wong, changed all that. The second season began with the suspenseful 'Beginning and the End', where Frank Black pursues the mysterious Polaroid Man who kidnapped his wife. This episode also introduces the comic relief for Season Two, computer hacker Brian Roedecker.

Even though 'The Beginnning And the End' would fit perfectly in Season 1, the subsequent episodes follow a different path that greatly improved the series. Starting with the second episode, 'Beware of the Dog', and continuing with episodes such as 'The Hand of St. Sebastian', 'Owls', 'Roosters', and the haunting two-part season finale 'The Fourth Horseman/The Time Is Now', we find out that the Millennium Group has existed since the beginnings of Christianity and isn't nearly as altruistic as Frank Black (and the viewers) originally suspected.

In addition to the Millennium Group storyline, we also learn more about Frank's childhood via two holiday episodes: 'The Curse of Frank Black', a Halloween-themed tale where Frank encounters the ghost of a neighbor who committed suicide, and 'Midnight of the Century', an emotional story of Frank trying to mend the relationship between him and his father. In the latter we find out that Frank was not the only one with a strange gift, as his mother was blessed/cursed with the ability to see angels. Lastly the second season even showcased two comedy episodes: 'Jose Chung's DOOMSDAY DEFENSE' and 'Somehow Satan Got Behind Me'. These hours of television are completely different from the average ""Millennium"" episode (to say the least) but they're still worth a look nonetheless.
I could continue rambling on and on about the greatness of Season Two, but you'll really have to buy the DVD set and form your own opinions. The DVD set does come with some bonus features, but the only one of worth is the Season Two documentary ""Turning of the Tide"". The rest of the bonus materials are second-rate at best

655,"	Its not THAT bad...
 	One of the most maligned movies of 2004 is...not that bad. In a fine example of how critics and Hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it, Oliver Stone delivers an epic take on the life of Alexander the Great. Not up to par with the great Hollywood epics, but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe.

The incredible life of Alexander the Great is epic movie material if I've ever seen any. His rise to ruler of The World by his mid twenties is chronicled here (with noticeable gaps in the timeline). His personal life is just as fascinating as his public one. His decidedly odd family life (as depicted by Stone, anyway) and his lovers (both male and female) are just as integral to the story as his military victories. Perhaps, the ultimate momma's boy just wanted to be loved.

Alexander is a workable and sometimes fascinating historical epic. It certainly doesn't deserve the drubbing it got in the press. Wonderful cinematography and a fascinating subject are undermined by uneven performances and some poor storytelling decisions, but there's a lot to like. I'll take my history this way instead of as an over sentimentalized bit of claptrap like The Patriot or Pearl Harbor any day. Forget the buzz and check it out. Rent it. If, like me, you find much to enjoy there are plenty of copies on any used DVD rack. Give it a chance and make the decision for yourself. My bet is you'll find a lot to appreciate.

 	Seriously! At the end of Fat Eliminator Minna says ""do this program on a regular basis and watch your body change"". It's true. I have been doing this DVD and only this DVD for about a month now - 3 days a week is Fat Eliminator and 2 days is Strength and Grace and my body is firm! I have abs now, biceps and definition in my thighs and buns. Extra flab is gone. This is a fantastic workout combination. FE is tough, particularly the first three cardio circuits. Those plyo jumping jacks are killer. Once I get through that third cardio circuit though I feel like I've already had a good workout and I'm only halfway through! I work up a sweat - I can't even answer the phone because I couldn't talk even if I wanted to. It's definitely focused on your lower body with lots of jumping and plyo and core work but the circuits are quick and they really do go by quickly. The workout is also fantastic in that just when you feel like you can't do one more plyo lunge, she changes the pace to something more less impact. The 15 minute Blast The Fat toning section I always add onto the cardio days. It's nice, quick and effective and in one hour while my son is napping I get in a total body workout.

I also LOVE the Strength and Grace segment. I enjoy alternating my days with this. It's a perfect combination of relaxing and energizing and I still work hard, just without all the jumping around. My heart rate does get up there and again you do a lot of leg work for those nice glutes and thighs. 

Minna is a beautiful woman and I appreciate her demeanor and her physique. There is just something about her that is completely likable. Overall, I am extremely impressed with these workouts - the results I have seen will defintely make me continue these workouts

659,"	Great film, not so great dvd
 	The Movie: One of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90's, and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved, this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind. And despite the whining from some, usually hardline Christian, corners, it's not anti-christian at all. What it is is simply great, imaginative and clever film making, and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from Mimi Rogers, ably supported by the likes of David Duchovny, Will Patton and Patrick Bauchau. 

I'm not going to go into it too deeply simply because it's one of those films that should be seen and experienced with as little up front knowledge as possible. 

(Please note that I'm not attacking Christians or Christianity above, just a small, but, as usual, vocal closed minded minority that always gets up in arms about any film that dares tackle any such subject with any degree of honesty instead of going down the traditional biblical fawning path. People who will instantly hate a film like this just ""on principle"" and then proclaim to all that they should avoid ""such trash"". You know exactly the kind of people I'm talking about. They're a minority, they just happen to be a very vocal and closed minded one. And none of that has anything to do with their christianity as much as it has to do with their absolute closed mindedness and their fear of anything that dares stray from a certain comfortable path.)

The DVD: The good news, this film is finally on dvd, and with a pretty decent audio commetary to boot. The bad news, the movie has been badly misframed, which is something that becomes obvious in a couple of key scenes especially. I'm not sure whether this was done as a form of censorship (as the misframing of one scene does effectively nullify a sequence of any real nudity that it once had) or whether it was just a botched transfer, but it is clearly misframed regardless as I saw this film twice on it's theatrical run and the framing is different now than it was then. Plus the misframing is quite obvious anyway, and on the audio commentary you can even hear remarks about the film pertaining to parts of the print that are no longer visible due to said misframing (so clearly they were watching the film in it's proper framing). 

Unfortunately this doesn't appear to be available anywhere else on dvd, so if you want the film on dvd right now this is your only option, just be aware going in, and hope for a better release somewhere down the track. Apart from the framing issue the sound and audio quality are perfectly fine, and the only other notable extra is the film's trailer.

The bottom line: A really good, bold, interesting film on a disappointing and variable quality dvd.

660,"	The Age of Innocence - ""I can't love you unless I give you up""......
 	There are many reviews here and I believe in their own way they all are right about this film to some degree.  My main recommendation is to be sure to watch it more than once.  If you do, it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place.  Daniel Day-Lewis once again makes this film.  You feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the ""wrong woman"" (Pfeiffer) after being engaged to the ""right woman"" (Ryder).  He is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film.  Due to circumstances beyond his control, he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman. There is a palpable, underlying  eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair.  

After I had watched this film one time, (primarily due to Day-Lewis)I had decided to give it away.  I left it alone for about 2 weeks and then watched it again.  Since then I have watched it several times and I enjoy it more and more with each viewing.  My only real complaint; I hate the blond hair they gave Pfeiffer.  It's just all wrong for her. Nevertheless, she is so beautiful.  Take the time to watch this at least two times.  If you do, I think you'll find it's a keeper

 	This show really is a love it or hate it kinda deal. From the first time it aired in the summer of 2005 on comedy central up until now i've been a huge fan of the series. I was so sad to hear it'd been cancelled but I wasn't surprised. It was one of the shows I loved and planned my night around when new episodes were going to air. Now that the DVDs are out I can relive these 13 fleeting moments in TV that are, to me, some of the funniest things I've ever seen. Apart from the hilarious, oddball performances from Michael Michael and David the series was packed with guest stars including Edward Norton, Paul Rudd, and a whole lot more. Really, anyone that is a fan of comedy ala Strangers with Candy will find this funny. It has a similar nonsensical insanity that leaves you laughing til it hurts. 

Favorite episodes include:
Campaign
Paper Route
Coffee Shop
Novel
Meeting Girls
and
Vegetables

The extras on the DVD are really top notch including commentary tracks for every episode, a lengthy and interesting ""History of Stella"" and much more. The commentaries are just about as funny as the episodes as the three creators continue to riff on each other, giving some insight into the creation process, while remaining pretty well aware their show met with sub-par ratings. They take it all in stride and aren't too proud to poke fun at themselves. I think if this show had been on comedy central around the time Strangers with Candy was on it would have been given atleast three seasons. It's a shame. Definitely worth getting, turning off your phone, and spending a whole night plowing through the whole season. ""And when I say plow that's a pun!

In any case, it is worth turning off the phone and spending a whole night hacking through the season. 'And when I say plough, it's a pun!"

 	Excellent series.  The court room scene is hilarious.  I am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti Americanism of this series (I refer to the portrayal of the American guest) as well as in Upstairs Downstairs?  In both series, as in other British TV dramas, Americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic.  What about the Henry James/Edith Wharton type aristocrats who toured England in the 19th century?  Mr. Hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them.

664,"	New Extended Cut is Worth Buying
 	If you're a fan of vampires, werewolves, action, or gothic suspense, this is probably a movie you'd be interested in checking out. While it's not a groundbreaking film, it's a highly entertaining one, and one that, for me, is something I can rewatch several times per year.

The filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can't see what's going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting. (Please don't mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle.) The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie. And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by ""The Matrix"", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie.

The only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there's not a single joke in the entire thing! Everything is so serious and dark that unless you're in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down...that's how heavy it is.

As for the set. The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45-minute documentary ""Fang vs. Fiction"", which talks about vampires and werewolves. It was very intriguing.

If you're a fan of this movie and you own the DVD already, I would recommend selling it and buying this version, it's worth the money

 	As I understand it, ""Police Squad"" was one of the most requested titles for release on DVD.  It's taken a while for it to happen, but it finally has!  It's great to be able to replace my VHS tape that I recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a ""Police Squad"" marathon.  Having now watched the DVD, I now know that for almost 20 years, I've been watching heavily edited versions of the show.  But not anymore!  

Other reviewers have described the episodes, so I won't waste time doing that.  Suffice it to say, the show was ahead of its time as it really didn't become popular until it was made into the first Naked Gun movie 6 years later (and had two subsequent hit sequels).  But I was one of the few who knew in 1982 that it was a clsassic.  I always wondered why the show never worked on TV, but Leslie Nielsen probably explains it best in his interview that is included on the DVD.  He says that you actually had to pay attention and most TV is meant to be watched almost passively while doing something else.  And I think he's right.

So it's great to have these shows.  The extras are just so-so as the interview with Nielsen is too short and I don't think the commentaries give much to the episodes (especially the one commented on by Robert Wuhl of ""Arliss"" fame, who was a writer for the show).  Wuhl must say a dozen times ""I don't remember this.""  Might have helped, Bob, if you took 25 minutes to watch it before watching it for the commentary.  But I won't trim the rating.

This screen shows a screen capture of a film frame that appears at 19:46 in the movie.  The capture was taken from the Widescreen matted version of the film, and the ""Full Frame"" image displayed is simply a cropped version of the Widescreen image.

668,"	Season 3--Steele as good as ever!
 	SEASON 1: Wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit, incredible acting for a TV series, and classic plots.  All around a great opening season for a classic show.

SEASON 2: Great story lines, very different plots, thickening of the chemistry between Remington and Laura with lots of cliff-hanger moments.  The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made.

SEASON 3: TOPS the first two seasons.  It's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting.  The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great, classic show.  Laura (Stephanie) and Remington (Pierce) are really just starting to get into the groove of their ever-messy, non-relationship, relationship, and Mildred (Doris) is just starting to blossom as an actual ""Gumshoe"".  It is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons.

The good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them.  I would highly recommend purchasing Seasons 1-3 (because I've seen them already), as well as the final set of discs (Seasons 4  and  5), even though I have not yet watched them (I'm trying to drag it out and make the show last longer!).

One MAJOR down-side (not with the show itself but with the DVD discs) is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs--stopping completly, skipping to the end or back to the beginning, skipping chapters, etc.  One disc will not even play in our computer, which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in Africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax.  It's too bad that they don't take more care transfering great shows like this to quality DVD's for years of non-skipping enjoyment.  The same disc didn't have as much trouble playing in our actual DVD player once we were back in the States, but still skipped from time to time.

it has alot of characters in it but not so much that u will get lost in all of them since they usually die or just dont appear until later in the film.It has some twists which are good.The american leaves out soo sooo much. In the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people. In the Japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help.  anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves  Asian horror and likes a good plot and movie!! go see it!! and enjoy

However, this does keep you glued to the screen and wondering what will happen in the end, and the film is a delight to watch purely because the children are so cute. Elijah Wood is stunning, only due to his efforts can the film get some believability. Caulkin is perfect in this role too, portraying the bad boy, I have no idea why people would point out his acting as poor.  Maybe only comparing to Elijah, but hey, he is widely consirered as one of the most talanted actors of his generation and the most talanted holywood child star ever, so no wonder you cannot compete with him... Anyway, this film is certainly worth watching as a family entertainment and is absolutely a must for Elijah Wood fans!

672,"	An interesting docudrama Civil War reenactors will enjoy.
 	In all fairness, this film is advertized on the package as a ""docudrama"" and not as a drama. The problem is that it isn't clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its 140th anniversary. As a documentary about the reenactment, this is a fine collection of footage, interspersed with some (thankfully) brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides. (Actually, I thought the actor portraying Longstreet did a fine job -- the others were less convincing.) As a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle. 

As a reenactor, I found it interesting watching the various units on the field. Despite the occassional glimpse of earplugs and sunglasses, the equipment and uniforms appear reasonably authentic. Of course, given the generous build of most of the reenactors in this film the title should have been ""Three Days of Density"" instead. I kid my fellow reenactors...unfortunately most people who have the money to spend on reenacting also have too much money to spend on good food and drink, myself included.

So, if you want to really learn about the battle, read Harry W. Pfanz's trilogy or Stephen Sears' book. If you want to see what Civil War reenacting on a grand scale can be like, this is a fine introduction

673,"	Lily, Rick and their fractured families struggle through to the ""again"" part
 	Watching ""Once and Again"" is one of the most painful television shows to watch, let along watch again.  This is not because it is a bad television show, but because when it comes to dealing with the aftermath of divorce it is the most painfully realistic television show that has aired to date.  I would like to be able to identify with Rick, but my personal situation is more like that of Jake, and instead of focusing on the romantic relationships between the adults I keep paying more attention to the pain of the children when they talk about what divorce has done to them.  Watching ""Once and Again: The Complete Second Season"" on DVD, the character I found myself paying attention to more than the first time around when the series aired on ABC was that of Zoe Manning.  There is a moment when she reads her parents, Lily and Jake, the riot act regarding being the youngest and not only getting hand me downs from her older sister Grace, but also ending up with less years where the family (""Scribbling Rivalry"").  Anybody who has been in a family that has gone through a divorce will find this show hits home time and time again.  If you have been spared that particular experience, then I really do not know why you would want what these people go through.

If the first season of ""Once and Again"" is about Lily Manning and Rick Sammler falling in love, then the second season is about how that relationship has a ripple effect with their family as the inevitability of the relationship forces their children and ex-spouses to a new level of acceptance.  There is actually more abut Lily and her new job (e.g., ""Scribbling Rivalry"") and Rick working on a mega-project for Miles Drentell (""Edifice Wrecked""), than there is about them being with each other.  While Lily and Rick are happy, for the most part, everybody else is wallowing in misery to varying degrees, and throughout the season getting all the kids together and on the same page proves to be problematic again and again (e.g, ""Feast or Famine"").  The major irony is that the dyad I am most interested in is Karen and Jessie, especially knowing what is going to happen to Karen in the third season and what Evan Rachel Wood has done since this show ended (although I am equally impressed by Julie Whalen as a young actress as well).  So I tend to pay attention to what each of those characters are doing, albeit for different reasons, but with more of an appreciation of how Jessie is her mother's daughter, which is not always a good thing (""Best of Enemies""), especially since Jessie is having trouble adjusting to high school and stops eating (""Food for Thought"").

Having Miles Drentel is a mixed blessing, because while watching David Clennon is always a pleasure, when he becomes a wedge between Rick and David it is like watching Michael and Elliot on ""thirtysomething"" all over again.  But it does inspire a true moment of vision for Rick (""Ozymandias 2.0""), and by the end of the season it becomes clear that the purpose of having Miles around is to bring Rick down to the point that all he can offer Lily is himself at the end because his professional reputation and business are pretty much shot.  This becomes important because it means Rick and Lily do not have the money to find a house where their merged families can have enough space to breathe, let alone live.  But dramatically the whole bit of Karen and her law firm trying to stop Miles, and Rick, from building their project is more interesting (""Edifice Wrecked""), especially when it seems Rick might end up going to prison (""Won't Someone Please Help George Bailey Tonight"").  When the psychiatrist that Jessie is seeing points out that only married people get as angry as Rick and Karen get at each other, it seems so obvious.  

This really is a year of one step forward and one step backwards for most of the characters.  Jake is the big hero when an emotionally disturbed bus boy shows up at the restaurant with a gun (""The Other End of the Telescope""), but bails on Tiffany when she wants him to be a father to their baby (""Forgive Us Out Trespasses"").  Judy comes up with the great idea of ""Booklovers,"" despite Lily's negativity, but needs the entire rest of the season to figure out Will Gluck.  Eli has found something he likes and is good at with his music (""I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down""), but is unable to build on it as his problems with school and romance continue.  Note: why Rick and Karen wasted time letting Eli apply to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana is beyond me, because I have taught there and my oldest daughter is graduating from there this December.  I have to tell you that unless Eli is going on a basketball scholarship, he is not getting it to that school and thinking he had a chance was a totally unrealistic expectation.   So, my question is whether the people who put the show together know this was a big mistake and it is an insight into Eli's parents, or simply me once again reading way too much into the situation.    

My only real complaint is that this time around it becomes clearer to me that Lily is really way too judgmental.  At least when she does not immediately accept Rick's proposal (another painfully true moment for me), she does not leave him hanging for long and I liked the way he found out she had accepted his ring.  The fact that season two ends with the wedding (""The Second Time Around"") might seem like the end of the story, but only if you make the mistake of thinking ""Once and Again"" was simply about Lily getting remarried.  It really is about trying to make two families one, which is why fans are sitting around waiting for the third and unfairly final (and incomplete) season to come out on DVD

That being in office would have held this man back. His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious. This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do. Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes. He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info.  If you think this might be too boring for your taste, give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish.

Terry Gilliam is the Orson Welles of our time.  Lambasted by critics for his excesses, admired by others for his genius.  I'm with the genius crowd.  Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I've seen in a long while.  Gilliam's style is baroque, and by a director who knows the definition.  Visually, this can be quite stunning, as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene.  Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas.  It's 1812, the Age of Napoleon, not a good time for the Imagination.  Nevertheless, con-men Jake  and  Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear, since it's also an Age of Anxiety, and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night.  The bumbling Grimms are played, quite effectively by Matt Damon (who pulls off the accent nicely) and Heath Ledger (a head scratching, eye-squinting success).  Their evil counterparts, End Products from the Age of Reason, are a French general, played by Jonathan Pryce, and his wacky henchman, played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare.  Little girls are disappearing in a small town, and something needs to be done about it.  And the Grimms are caught in the middle.  You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales, as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery.  To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises.  Check it out

684,"	That Monk is one smart cookie.
 	""Monk"" is quite an interesting show. It is about this character named Adrian Monk (played by Tony Shalhoub, ""Wings""), who is an obsessive compulsive detective with many phobias. He is also incredibly intelligent; he can literally solve any kind of case rather quickly, provided that he has all the right clues. The most interesting aspect of this is that one never knows when Monk might have an idea on what the mystery might be until he utters four immortal words, which, for some of the most intense cases, will really shock the audience: ""I've solved the case."" However, for some reason, the best part always seems to be when he says, ""Here's what happened.""

When it comes to the scenes involving murder cases, it must be known that the antagonists of some episodes can get very, very brutal. They will do things like whack people against the head with crowbars, slice up their bodies with chainsaws, smash their hands with car doors, and sometimes, they will even try drowning them, and like the antagonists of ""MacGyver,"" they are not afraid to use guns, if necessary.

The acting is phenomenal especially by Tony Shalhoub and Ted Levine (Capt. Stottelmeyer). The photography and cinematography are also well done and enhances each scene in each episode. Finally, this DVD is practically perfect in picture and sound quality. It has extras like featurettes and you have the option of listening to it in three different languages; English, Spanish, and French. I found it all interesting. In conclusion, this TV show has it all: good background music, great dialogue, interesting stories, good acting, and interesting cinematography.

685,"	They are coming to blow Laurence Fishburne away
 	I did not see John Carpenter's original version of ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake. I was paying attention so I knew what the set up was, both inside and out of the precinct, as we went along. But being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in James DeMonaco's script (I made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters I was sure would survive all the bullets and I was half-right, which is a polite way of saying I was half-wrong). 

It is New Year's Eve in Jean-Francois Richet's film and it has started to snow heavily. Precinct 13 officially closes at the stroke of midnight and filling up the last boxes are Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), who has been hiding behind a desk ever since an undercover gig went horribly bad and he was wounded while his two partners were killed, grizzled veteran Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) who is always talking about retirement, and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) who is always talking about sex with bad boys. Jake would rather talk about sex than his feelings about what happened before with Alex Sabian (Mario Bello), the department shrink who happens to stop by on a snowy New Year's Eve to take another crack at Jake's psyche. 

Then a Detroit police transport bus shows up with a quartet of prisoners, unable to get to the prison because of the storm and a highway accident. There is Beck (John Leguizamo), who will not shut up, Anna (Alisha Hinds) a girl with a crew-cut who proclaims her innocence, Smiley (Ja Rule), a counterfeiter, and Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), the most notorious criminal in the city, who has just been arrested for murdering an undercover cop under suspicious circumstances. So when a couple of guys with guns break into the precinct and everybody is yelling these are Bishop's men coming to get get, we do not buy it. After all, as soon as Bishop saw them he hid behind a wall. Things are just beginning to get interesting. 

""Assault on Precinct 13"" is an action film where the human element is really more interesting once Jake figures out that to survive the night he needs everybody to help out, which means not only the prisoners but the women. Everybody gets a gun in this one, but you know full well that not everybody can be trusted with one. Furthermore, Jake is fully aware that Bishop is the smartest and deadliest person there, but this movie is all about making the best of a bad situation that keeps getting worse. The death of one character really puts the way this is going to play out into question, and I liked the note on which the film actually ends once we finally get down to the inevitable confrontation between the two main characters. Not great, but certainly an enjoyable action picture with a minimum amount of stupidity on the part of the characters once you accept the idea the die is cast and it is all or nothing for the bad guys. That is a pretty good recommendation for this genre

They really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal, too. I guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original wasn't anywhere to be seen in this one, but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it. 

Oh, and the children seemed ESPECIALLY bratty this time, which made it better when those bad things happened to them.  A friend pointed out to me that this version has a LOT more musical numbers.  Good call.  I don't know if the ending was better than the original, but it was certainly a very good, interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake.  I don't want to reveal what happens at the end, so let's just say that when the factory tour is over, and Charlie leaves, there's still a decent chunk of storyline left.  

I was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of ""living in a world of chocolate"" element wasn't really there, which is definitely a bad thing.  I mean, come on.  We ALL want a world of chocolate!  I just feel there should have been more chocolate-related things included in the film.

697,"	Two excellent films for one low price
 	Spider-Man (2002.) The first Spider-Man film.
Spider-Man 2 (2004.) The second Spider-Man film. 

INTRODUCTION: 
In 2002, the first of the live-action Spider-Man hit theatres. It's not likely that the film's director, Sam Raimi, had any idea just how successful his big-screen incarnation of the classic superhero would be. It drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres, and the DVD releases did the same. The sequel, appropriately enough, was even more hyped, and did even better. And now, both films have been combined into a single set! Read on for my review of the Spider-Man films.

STORYLINE: 
Essentially, this set includes both of the films. The first of the two films explains how Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into Spider-Man. In the first film, the villain is former head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn, who has been transformed into the Green Goblin by a chemical he was testing. The second film continues two years after the first left off, and features Spider-Man facing off against Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body. This time around, juggling the duties of being Spider-Man with work and school have made Peter Parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle. 

OPINIONS: 
Both of these films flat-out rule. Seeing the first film turned me into a Spider-Man fan practically overnight. The acting and storyline are both excellent, particuarly Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Everything the first film did well, the second one does even better. I was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film, since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them - but Sam Raimi does it here. These are great films, and the fact that they're together in one package only sweetens the deal.

DVD: 
These are the standard DVD releases of the film, meaning each one has a bonus disc of material. There are a ton of bonus features, including commentary, cast and crew interviews, and assorted other extras too. The second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books, and the plotlines of them! That's my favorite extra on either of the discs. The other features are also excellent, and if you like the films, you'll agree they're worthwhile.

OVERALL: 
I can't begin to express my satisfaction with these films. The cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece, and I think you'll agree superhero movies don't get any better. Being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet. These are must-watch movies, regardless of who you are. Even if you're not a big fan of the Spider-Man franchise, you may be pleasantly surprised
",1,"Two excellent films for a low price Spider-Man (2002.) The first Spider-Man movie. Spider-Man 2 (2004.) The second Spider-Man movie. INTRODUCTION: The first live-action Spider-Man was released in 2002. It is unlikely that the film's director, Sam Raimi, had any idea how successful his incarnation of the classic superhero would be on the big screen. It attracted huge amounts of money to cinemas, and DVD releases did the same. The sequel was, fittingly, hyped up even more and even better. And now both films have been combined into one set! Read on for my review of the Spider-Man movies. STORYLINE: Essentially, this set includes both movies. The first of the two films tells how Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into Spider-Man. In the first film, the villain is former Oscorp boss Norman Osborn, who has been transformed into the Green Goblin by a chemical he tested. The second film continues two years after the first, and shows Spider-Man standing up to Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist who has gone mad for not getting the credit he deserves for his work, and an electric shock that permanently grafts mechanical arms onto his body. This time, juggling work and school duties as Spider-Man, Peter Parker has been asked whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle. OPINION: Both films are usually unable to live up to expectations."

 	The movie was terrific, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because there was quite a bit of Spanish in the film, and the subtites from Spanish to English didn't seem to work on my copy.   English subtitles appeared for Engliish, and Spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke Spanish!  Strange.  Fortunately I know some Spanish, so i could sort of pick it up, but I don't know why the sub titles didn't work. Anyway,  Bogie was very good and the story was too.  Three men set out to find gold, and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey.  Besides all that were the usual bandits and Indians and so forth.  But it kept you watching and that's what really counts.  Won't tell you if they got any gold!

705,"	Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut
 	What can one add to what's already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time? ""Citizen Kane"" has been analyzed more than any other movie, in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as ""Kane"" itself. It's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" and the HBO film ""RKO 281.""

I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who have watched ""Citizen Kane"" once and thought it was just OK.  But seeing it once is simply not enough. This is true of any great film, but more so for ""Kane,"" a multifaceted work that cannot be fully digested upon first viewing. In many ways, ""Kane"" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it.

Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry. Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.

The expertly produced documentary, ""The Battle over Citizen Kane,"" recounts the factors that nearly prevented Welles' film from seeing the light of day. But it belabors the comparison between Welles and Hearst. Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter. By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles' career tanked after ""Kane,"" the documentary glosses over Welles' achievements. Welles went on to make several great films, two of which (""Touch of Evil"" and ""Chimes at Midnight"") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to ""Kane.""

While the documentary overdoes the comparisons between Welles and Hearst, ""RKO 281"" distorts the relationship between Welles (Liev Schrieber) and ""Kane"" co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (John Malkovich). Mankiewicz was holed up with Welles' Mercury Theatre partner John Houseman - not Welles - at Victorville, and Houseman was Welles' confidant throughout the ""Kane"" controversy, not Mankiewicz.  If the film simplifies real-life relationships, it remains an enjoyable - if somewhat lightweight - re-enactment of the controversy, with great performances by James Cromwell as the imperious Hearst and Melanie Griffith as the ditsy Marion Davies.

Back to the inevitable question: is ""Citizen Kane"" the greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though ""Touch of Evil"" might be even better among Welles' own films. But ""Kane"" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. ""Citizen Kane"" has topped the highly regarded ""Sight and Sound"" polls since 1962, and the American Film Institute reinforced ""Kane's"" #1 status with its 1998 Top 100 list. Can all the critics, experts, and film buffs all be wrong? Watch ""Citizen Kane"" - not once, but twice or more - and decide for yourself

708,"	Childhood revisited.
 	The Legend of Zelda: Complete Animated Series sits high up on the forgotten mountain of what children's cartoon should be, right there with ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" ""Street Sharks,"" and ""Recess."" The Legend of Zelda was (and still is) such an exceptional video game series for all ages, and the TV show followed in its footsteps. It combined pleasantly cartoony action and adventure with cheesy one-liners, and some jokes that still today make me laugh. ""Lookin' good, Princess! 'Specially from THIS angle!"" As children we see Link yell that to Zelda on a balcony below him and brush it off as the banter in between those amazing battle sequences. But later, that comment makes us young adults convulse with glee, and wonder how we ever missed it before.

But the series is most enjoyable for those of us who faithfully stuck to the actual video game series. The implimentation of original 8-bit sound effects into the cartoon is an added bonus that draws us back for more. And waiting to see which classic Zelda enemy will cause Link and Zelda trouble next is just that much more fun (especially if you can name them).

But by far the most fun thing about this show is waiting and praying for the day when Link can coax a kiss out of the lovely Princess. And they've come so close it almost made me angry when they got interrupted. Link tries so hard, and makes such an idiot out of himself trying, that you'd think he deserves a little action once in a while. but every time, no matter how he tries, he either messes up or is interrupted by Ganon's non-stop attempts to steal the Triforce.

All in all, if you grew up with te Super Mario Super Show, and you're a Nintendo fan, you'll appreciate this show as much as you love to watch it

709,"	Wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy/Action/Adventure
 	This is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor  and  I really enjoyed watching it.  I think it has great replay value  and  as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness.  I found it more reminiscent of the old 60's films like 'Monte Carlo or Bust' or 'Those Magnificent men....'.  Jackie Chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action-packed foil to 'Fillius Fogg' played with brilliant English reserve  and  self-deprecating humor by 'Steve Coogan'.  There's no comparison to the original  and  the film doesn't even try to copy.  Rather, it takes a silly story with silly character's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family action/adventure/comedy movies you'll see.  Because this isn't a typical 'Martial Arts' vehicle for 'Jackie Chan' I found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline.  Check out for instance the fight-scene in the Art-Gallery which goes to show why 'Jackie Chan' is probably the best Action/Comedy star in the world right now. There's much that's Chaplain/Keaton-like in his performance  and  all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts. The guest-stars are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices, most notably 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' (What I think is the best Comedy ever  and  this is by no means a comparison).  Anyway 'Arnold Swarzenneger' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a Turkish Prince no less (Possibly the poorest Arabian impression ever, which is of course why it works so well) and 'Rob Schneider' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice.  Miss 'Cecile de France' is a beautiful Comedy foil  and  manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent  and  I hope to see more from her.  You might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but I found a lot of it to be nicely restrained, this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set, check out the extras.  All in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy/Action/Adventure with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing.

710,"	Hilarious
 	The main character, Lebowski, is a bum of a person living in Los Angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Suddenly Lebowski's life is changed when he is mistaken for another Lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters.

The plot evolves as many other Coen movies (Raising Arizona comes to mind) as we are introduced to more-and-more colorful characters and the plot gets more-and-more outrageous, yet somehow still seems real.

My favorite component of this film is the character played by John Goodman, a Polish Viet-nam veteran who converted to Judaism after marrying his ex-wife. He has a hair-brained plan to help Lebowski extricate himself from the mix-up mess and he doesn't bowl on Shabbos. He also baby-sits his ex-wife's Pomeranian when she goes out of town. 

If you liked Raising Arizona you'll want to watch this movie over and over again

711,"	The Dude Abides.
 	""The Dude, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or, uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing."" Those are The Dude's immortal words he used to introduce himself to the other Jeffery Lebowski. You're probably thinking ""What is he talking about, who is the other Jeffery Lebowski?"", well I'll tell you in just a moment, I've just got some things to clear up first. Joel and Ethan Coen have made some of the most loved films of all time, and are one of the most criticly acclaimed film making duos/team of all time. These fellows bought you the cult favourite Blood Simple, the hillarious Raising Arizona, the decietful Millers Crossing, the crazy Barton Fink, The Hudsuckers Proxy, and the blood drenched Fargo, and now this, one of the finest films they've done, The Big Lebowski. Jeff Bridges is Jeffery Lebowski or in this case, The Dude. John Goodman plays the Vietnam veteran Walter, Steve Buscemi is not in it too often, but he plays the loveable Donnie. Let's just go through the character sketches(only The Dude's bowling pals).

Characters:
The Big Lebowski's main character is The Dude, he lives in LA, he listens to Creedance Clearwater Revival, his favourite drink is a white russian, and he loves bowling. The film is set in, as we've established before, Los Angeles. The Dude is an average joe slacker who dresses in, as what you could say, 'the hippie who likes to surf clothing'. Sandals, shorts, crummy old shirts, jersey jackets(jackets that are jerseys),he never wears socks with his shoes(even in bowling shoes) and occasionly, glasses. Let's  also not forget his long hair that makes The Dude's image so legandary. The Dude's bowling buddies are Walter Sobchak, and Donny. Walter is a Vitnam veteran and refers everything to nam'. He mostly wears shorts, a shirt with a sleeveless jacket, hiking shoes, socks(obviously), and always, and I mean ALWAYS wears his aviator sun glasses. He also has sort of an army man buzz cut with a beard around his mouth. Donny, is a great bowler, whenever we see him bowl, he gets a strike, except for once later on(don't want to spoil anything). That's all we bassicly know about him except that he usually(when bowling) wears long pants, a bowling shirt tucked in and a haircut where is hair isn't too long or too short. He's a nice guy and is usually told to shut up by Walter because of his late involvement in conversations with The Dude and Walter.

The plot:
The movie kicks off with a man narrating. He has a Texan accent and talks about a man named Jeffery Lebowski who also goes by the name 'The Dude', and is the supposed storyteller of The Dude's story, but doesn't narrate until later on. As he narrates we see The Dude in a grocery store in his sandals and the previous statements I made of the clothes he wears, he's looking at milk and tests one of them to see if it's sour, he later arrives home with his purchased milk but is surprised by two thugs, they dunk his head in the toilet and are telling him to give them the money that Bunny owes them. They later realise that it's not the Jeffery Lebowski they're after, they've soiled The Dude's rug and they eventually leave, but The Dude wants to get to the man who they were supposed to get, this is the other Jeffery Lebowski I was talking about and is the millionaire Lebowski, he's bassicly the title's name ""The Big Lebowski"". The Dude pitches up at the millionaire's mansion and attempts to get a free carpet in exchange for what the thugs were supposed to do to The Big Lebowski's carpet. He eventually get's what he wants but is then later called by Jeffery Lebowski to drop off money to kidnappers who kidnapped his trophy wife Bunny. To cut this short, the film is about The Dude trying to get Bunny back to Jeffery Lebowski, and how he has to deal with other problems that Jeffery Lebowski has, because people come looking after him because of the same name he shares with the millionaire Lebowski. The drop off of the kidnapping leads to all of his other problems. Walter is told about the ransom money by The Dude and decides that The Dude and himself should keep the money instead, because Walter thinks that Bunny kidnapped herself. Walter gives the kidnappers a bag full of dirty laundry that he had, so they keep the money in the car when they go bowling, as they come out, his car is gone. So they have to get the money back without Jeffery Lebowski knowing.

The film is hilarious, but that doesn't mean that it's just a normal movie, it's stunnig. The dialogue is sharp and witty, although there's alot of swearing, that doesn't mean the humour is just fowl mouthed, it's hillarious, some of the lines go down in history as some of the funniest one liners ever. The Coen's writing here is as good as ever, with excelently written and thought out characters. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are absolutely hilarious, they're definately the funniest characters in this movie(Jesus is also funny), and make you wish the film would never end. The other things that are worth watching the film for are the acid trip sequences and the absolutely incredible vintage rock soundtrack.

This is a comedy lover's dream come true. If you love the Coens and excellent snappy humour then this is a must have for you. even you don't know the Coens too well or even comedy, then here's a film too start with. Just buy this now, or soon, or whenever you have a split second of a chance to buy it.

I can't tell you what the special features are on this disc, because I have the region 2 edition. This one most probably has the same trailer my one has. So if it's the same as the region 2 features, then it's got absolutely no good special features worth writing about

Eric Stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who wants to pursue art instead of business. Mary Stuart Masterson is his best friend, a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him. Lea Thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty - and her boyfriend. Craig Scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend - and the only off note. 

Keith (Eric Stoltz) is interested in Amanda (Lea Thompson) and takes the opportunity to ask her out when she breaks up with her boyfriend. To spite the boyfriend, she says yes. Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) predicts trouble and their friendship is tested. My favorite line from the movie is when Keith defends Amanda, claiming, ""You can't judge a book by its cover."" Watts cynically replies, ""Yeah, but you can tell how much it's gonna cost."" Finally Watts agrees to help Keith prepare for the date, including helping him ""practice kissing"" - and it's a doozy of a kiss.

Throw in John Ashton as Keith's father, Maddie Corman as his meddlesome sister, and Elias Koteas as the scary guy Keith befriends in detention, and you have a ""wonderful"" movie

713,"	Two physicists caught in the uncertainty of human motives
 	Based on historical events which are still poorly undertsood, this movie depicts Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr - the titans of quantum mechanics in its halcyon days during the 1920s and 1930s - caught in an encounter which is a loose human analogy to Heisenberg's famous uncertainty principle (which demonstrates mathematically that you cannot know both the exact speed and position of a single electron). Drawing from the Tony Award-winning play by Michael Frayn (who also wrote Noises Off), the movie revolves around the dialogue between these two men (sometimes together with Bohr's wife) who meet in Copenhagen in 1942 when Heisenberg, the German, who has been placed within the scientific research progam of the Nazis in their quest to build a nuclear bomb, visits his mentor and colleague Bohr, the Dane who is living through Nazi occupation of his native land. There are deep unresolved questions about the motives of Heisenberg which the characters try to resolve in a series of talks and walks through the same park where the two physicists previoulsy stolled to debate the ideas which came to form the foundation of quantum physics. Set against a piano score which resonates with the inner sense of uncertainty and suspicion in the dialogue, the movie achieves some the things that the big stage does not allow, including flashbacks and scenes ranging back and forth between the park and Bohr's home. [Note: I enjoyed the movie as much as the play]. In an era where cinematic palates seem titillated mostly by fast action thrillers, this movie is another example of how well constructed dialogue makes for gripping cinematic drama when it goes hand in hand with superb casting and performance

715,"	Grapes of Wrath DVD Vs. the book
 	The Grapes of Wrath is a great movie, perhaps one of the best I have ever seen. However, having read the book, I notice that some of the most interesting parts of the story have been left out. By taking out these crucial, yet quiet scenes; the movie has a faster pace than the book.

In the movie, Grandpa died suddenly. The only explanation for his death was that he had a stroke. In the book, the preacher, Casy, explained to the family members that the old man could not leave his land, his home and his way of life. Casy explained that Grandpa was spiritually dead when he left his house, and it did not take long for his body to also die. This shows the great sacrifice that the Joads must make in order to survive. In the movie, it just seems that they pack up, leave, and arrive, without any moral dilemmas. Grandpa dies in another family's tent, not just on a blanket by the road. This is important because in the book it symbolizes the way people have to help one another in times of need. 

In the scenes in California, the pace slows down a bit, so I can feel the details of the book surface in the movie. With the events leading up to Casy's death crisp and clear, I could understand his death as brutal murder, and Tom's speech about him carrying on Casy's work beautifully taken from the book. I really loved these scenes, because unlike most of the movie, these scenes do remain true to the book, and because of that, they are full of detail, and you can see the hand of Steinbeck at work.

717,"	An interesting conversation with one of the world's most controversial architects
 	There simply is no more controversial architect in the world today than Frank Gehry and people have very strong opinions about his work.  He has both his passionate lovers and haters.  I am one of the very few who is somewhat in the middle.  I really love some of his work, while I find some of his work to be quite off putting.  The person in the film who probably got it better than anyone is a sympathizer of Gehry's work, art critic Claude Jencks (the person who popularized the term ""postmodern"").  Jencks, for whose deceased wife Gehry designed a memorial building, states bluntly that Gehry has made some ugly buildings.  I think with Gehry more than most architects, one must give oneself the freedom to hate or love his individual buildings without inhibition.  Whatever else one may say about Gehry, he isn't like other architects.

One reviewer below called this a ""puff piece,"" but that isn't really correct.  It is more correct to call it a conversation with a friend.  Gehry asked his close friend, the mainstream director Sydney Pollack, to make a documentary of his work.  The result is a fine portrait of Gehry's career.  Pollack certainly does not criticize his work, but interestingly he does not over praise it either.  They do call attention to the fact that many simply don't like his work and the film contains numerous excerpts from one of Gehry's more vociferous and respected critics, Hal Foster.  But the point of the film is not to provide an objective and critical overview of Frank Gehry's work.  The point is to get to know Frank Gehry and some of his ideas about architecture.  In this the film succeeds marvelously.

If one watches a number of documentaries about architects, one thing that is striking is how many of them are enormously likable individuals.  For every irascible Frank Lloyd Wright there are ten you'd love to sit down and have a beer with.  Much like I. M. Pei, Frank Gehry comes across as an immensely likable guy in this film.  Perhaps away from his friend's camera he is an implacable tyrant, but those qualities, if they exist, are not apparent here.  Instead, he comes across as a genuinely nice guy.  In fact, a couple of the individuals interviewed stress that as laid back as Gehry is, he really does have an ego.  I don't think I've ever heard a person in the creative field have anyone insist that appearance aside, they really do have an ego.  In the vast majority of cases, that is all too apparent.

I found it interesting to see the shots of Gehry and either of his design partners working with him on designs.  If you are accustomed to think of architecture as akin to drafting, watching Gehry work is a bit of a shock.  He doesn't design so much as sculpt.  He and his partners look like a couple of extremely mature kindergartners with scissors and paper as they cut, bend, shape, snip, and play with variations on the model they are struggling with.  There is apparently little or no concern with the particular materials to be used.  He seems rather to struggle with the kind of overall shape, with the assumption that with today's materials any kind of design can be turned into a reality.  The film really brings out how Gehry's own conception of architecture is much closer to sculpture than to engineering.

As a resident of Chicago, a city noted for his importance to twentieth century architecture, it has been amazing to realize how little of his work has been done here.  In fact, apart from his controversial (what else?) work in Millennium Park, I'm not aware of anything else he has done here.  As a result, I have less direct experience with Gehry's work than many other leading architects.  I must confess that much of what I see appears to be fascinating.  I would, for instance, absolutely love to see his Bilbao museum.  But there is one aspect to Gehry's work that I really applaud:  its emphasis on individualism.  One criticism of much architecture has been its essential conservativism.  Much of it espouses nonegalitarian and conformist values.  One sees exceptions, such as Louis Sullivan's refusal to put box seats in his Chicago Auditorium design.  If one looks at a Gehry design, it is hard to imagine it ever becoming the style of choice of a repressionistic, totalitarian regime.  It is too individualistic, too anarchic for that.  Even such a free spirit as Louis Kahn still designed the capitol of Bangladesh.  But it is simply impossible to imagine Frank Gehry designing a capitol.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I came away from it with a greater liking for Frank Gehry as a person than I had anticipated.  And perhaps I will in the future be more inclined to appreciate his designs.  He may not be the greatest of our architects, but he certainly is one of our more likable free spirits

720,"	A SUBLIME COLLECTION OF GREAT MUSICALS!
 	Warner has been doing a magnificent job of using the latest picture resolution process to restore and/or polish up their best movies; and again they do not disappoint! Warner Home Video truly hits a home run and does the incredible with this boxed set of five of the greatest musicals of all time! The set is well presented with excellent digital transfer, wonderful sound and a bevy of sublime extras.

The Band Wagon (which itself is a two DVD special edition) stars Fred Astaire as an older entertainer trying to be successful again in show business. Things do not go well: he doesn't like the director; there aren't fancy dance scenes that he prefers to perform and he has to dance with a ballerina! The show is unpopular and Fred's character Tony Hunter saves the day using his superior technique and know-how. The extras are wonderful! Liza Minnelli (whose Dad, Vincente Minnelli, did an excellent job as director of the picture) and Michael Feinstein provide an engaging commentary. There are also two documentaries: ""Get Aboard! The Band Wagon"" about the making of the movie and an older expose entitled ""The Men Who Made the Movies: Vincente Minnelli."" You won't regret these-they are excellent and very informative! SMILE There's also the outtake musical number of Two Faced Women. Very good! For Astaire fans there's an Astaire trailer collection and even a musical short of Jack Buchanan with the Glee Quartet. I was particularly pleased with the fine commentary Liza Minnelli and Michael Feinstein give here.

The other two disc special edition is of the MGM classic Easter Parade. Wow! This has always been one of my very favorite musicals. The acting and the chemistry between Astaire playing the professional dancer and Judy Garland playing Hannah Brown his at first unlikely dance partner-and eventually romantic partner-is nothing short of excellent and captivating! Ann Miller turns in a great performance as the dancer who leaves Fred's character to try to get even further ahead in her career. The digital quality of the video and the sound are both excellent. There's a documentary of the making of this movie and a particular favorite of mine is the American Masters documentary profile: ""Judy Garland: By Myself"" put out only with the essential effort of my friend John Fricke. (The American Masters documentary won more than just one Emmy, making this a particularly valuable extra! John won one of the Emmys for this; he is the leading Garland biographer who wrote several books on Judy.) John worked so hard on this profile! John's fine commentary along with Ava Astaire (Fred Astaire's daughter) proves to be an excellent resource for reliable information about this film and Judy. You also get the outtake musical number ""Mr. Monotony."" There's a Judy Garland trailer collection and some promotions for the original film are provided. Wow! A fine two disc set in and of itself. 

Bells Are Ringing is Judy Holliday's last performance; she plays a worker at a telephone answering service who gets overly involved with her client's personal lives. Jean Stapleton, a favorite actress of mine (from All In The Family as Edith) is in this picture as well. This picture was nominated for an Oscar for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture and the song ""Just In Time"" is certainly one good reason why! Outtake musical numbers include ""Is It a Crime?"" and ""My Guiding Star."" The digital transfer is again excellent and the sound quality is excellent. This is definitely a classic musical.

Brigadoon boasts a wonderful musical score by Lerner and Lowe. The principle cast is only the best: Gene Kelly, Van Johnson and Cyd Charisse. An adventurous American suddenly uncovers a magical Scottish town which is only visible one day a century! Does he stay there and perhaps experience a fine true love; or should he return to his life as it is? Quite the dilemma! There are three musical outtakes you want to look at: ""Come to Me Bend to Me,"" ""From This Day On,"" and ""Sword Dance."" An audio outtake and a brand new digital transfer make this a fine addition to the box set as well as your DVD collection.

Last, but certainly not least, is Finian's Rainbow. A wonderful fanciful musical, this film stars Fred Astaire in his final full length performance as Finian McLonergan. Somehow Finian steals a pot of gold from Og the leprechaun. Finian and his daughter Sharon (the lovely Petula Clark) go to America (as does Og) and use their powers to overcome a rather prejudiced senator. Not only are the musical numbers excellent; the cinematography is superlative and the ending is a happy one! There is an excellent commentary by director Francis Ford Coppola and a cute feature on the film's premiere. 

All in all, this is clearly one of the best boxed sets of supremely fine great musicals and it is very reasonably priced. For me personally this set was an easy decision-it is already in my personal DVD collection! I highly recommend this boxed set for fans of the great American musicals as well as all patrons of the arts. This is also a solid introduction to some of the quality musicals produced on film to date. Equally important, the hard work and effort everyone put into the seemingly countless extras is superlative.

 	The Great Dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director, Charlie Chaplin. The movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of World War 2 and at the rise of the Nazi party. The similarities between dictator Adolf Hitler and the comedic genius that is Charlie Chaplin is quite interesting: both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year, same month, in the same week. Chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing Hitler for this film; he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film. 
The Great Dictator has the ability to tug at your heart and make you laugh until you cry. The music is gorgeous and the writing is superb. Though some scenes do drag a bit, most of it flows smoothly. 
Perhaps the most famous scene in the movie is the final speech given by Chaplin. It is just him staring at the camera, and nothing stops him from saying what he feels.

The seemingly simple plot - two brothers in search of their missing dad - provides so much room for character growth that I wish there were an entire series of films centered around them.  

With a hard-edged view of the world as: ""There's no such thing as adventure. There's no such thing as romance. There's only trouble and desire"" (actually from a Fritz Lang movie of the 1920's) there's plenty going on to both prove and disprove Hartley's ambivalent theories.

Simple Men also formally introduces us to the absolutely delicious Elena L wensohn.  In one of the coolest and hottest scenes in all of cinema we get to watch her bizarre 50's beatnik-style dance to Sonic Youth's ""Kool thing.""  Then joined by the two lost soul brothers it turns into an unlikely production number.  

Many dismiss this film, and Hartley as unwatchable or trivial and miss the point.  What is amazing about Hartley is that he takes the seemingly trivial and elevates it to a level of art that, once seen, reflects our lives on every level from brilliance to the inane.  

Simple Men is pure cinematic delight.  

Hooray for Hartley

729,"	Great for beginners
 	Not being familiar with yoga, I chose this DVD because of Rodney Yee's reputation and the low cost.  What I found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed, and yet energized, after the first session.  There are no bells or whistles, just a great workout.  I've purchases two other titles in the series, Power Yoga - Strength and Power Yoga - Stamina, and I switch off each workout.  Some of the moves are more difficult than others, but it gives you something to work up to.  If I couldn't do a stretch, I would go as far as I could and hold it. It was a great feeling when I was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly I was unable to do.  Aside from these video's, the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain...  I DO know this for a fact.

731,"	Murder, Well Acted And With Some Ethical Questions
 	When Daryl Deever (William Hurt) tells TV reporter Tony Sokolow (Sigourney Weaver) he knows more than he actually does about a murder in the building where he works as a janitor, he gets more than he bargained for. Deever is a good guy, smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms. He's sort of engaged to his best friend's sister, but he's had a crush on Sokolow for two years. When the man in the building gets his throat slit, Sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene. Deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her, so he tells her he may know something. She goes after the story and he goes after her. Sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated, capable man known as Joseph (Christopher Plummer), who is good friends with Sokolow's parents. It becomes clear that her wealthy parents, their rich friends and Joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for Jews to escape from the Soviet Union and to journey to Israel. And it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement, too. Before long, the man's associates learn of Deever's gambit with Sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing. More lethally, the real murderer learns of what Deever said to Sokolow and believes Deever might actually know something. He goes after Deever.

This is a tight, well constructed murder mystery with two first-rate components. First is the romance which builds between the characters played by Hurt and Weaver. These two people are attractive and smart. Hurt, in particular, comes across as guileless but he's no one's patsy. The two are very likable. Second, the situation which develops poses some ethical questions. Grades of gray come into play; it wouldn't be accurate to say that the murderer is simply another bad guy.

The movie also features some first-rate actors besides Hurt and Weaver. There's Christopher Plummer who, as usual, brings so much assurance and nuance to his role; James Woods as the best friend, always a little off balance; Pamela Reed as Woods' sister; her mutual declaration of non-love with Hurt is very funny and appealing; Steven Hill and Morgan Freeman as the two cops assigned to the case; Kenneth McMillan as Hurt's father, angry and vulnerable; and Irene Worth and Albert Paulsen as Weaver's parents, people who love her but, especially the mother, always put responsibilities and obligations into the love. They all are very good.

I like this movie a lot. The DVD picture looks fine. There are no extras to speak of

 	Most people have a hard time adjusting to foreign films because reading subtitles and trying to watch the film is difficult.  That's why I love Melville's Le Samourai, not much speaking throughout the film equals minimal subtitles.  This film doesn't require many lines of speech.  The main character is an assassin who is hired to do a job and is rounded up by the police as a possible suspect.  While trying not to get arrested he is trying to find out who double crossed him.

 	SPOILERS

 When Star Trek's production crew started falling behind in both schedule and budgets during the first season, they came up with the brilliant idea of using the unsold The Cage pilot as the basis for a two part episode. The result: One of the most important and brilliant Treks ever done!

Everyone knows the basic plot by now: Spock kidnaps his crippled former Captain, and hijacks the Enterprise, and sets course for the one forbidden planet in all The Federation. He eventually is court-martialed en route, and presents as his evidence an unusally detailed account of the Enterprise's visit to Talos IV 13 years prior. 

THIS is the episode which cements Spock's character forever: the supposedly emotionless Vulcan, who demonstrates more passion and loyalty than most humans. Leonard Nimoy's performance is one of his best as Spock : initially seeming as though Spock had gone crazy almost, kidnapping Pike, using false computer tapes and voices to convince people that the ship is under 'secret orders', all sorts of indications SOMEthing must be wrong with Spock...until after the Talosian's plan is revealed,where it is found THEY have been manipulating events all along, and Spock returns to his stoic self.....except..when leaving the briefing room with Pike for the last time, his head bowed, shoulders slumped.

Shatner's understated performance in this has been sloughed off in some circles. I say :'unfair'...Frankly, it is PERFECT for the events - all during these events, Kirk acts rather stunned at all these events: His friend and 1st Officer has seemingly gone crazy and hijacked his ship, he almost dies going after him in a shutle, THEN he is releived of command for all of this! By the time the Talosians supposedly abandon Spock and forces the trial board to take a vote, even Kirk is convinced Spock should be put away.But..at the end..is able to smile when the Talosian shows him the 'rejuvenated' Pike happy again at last.

All of these performances are directed with care by Marc Daniels, the veteran TV director who was at the helm of the 'envelope'. They make an deliberate  point of cutting to the more mature, unemotional Spock during the famous 'laughing' scene,and you can ALMOST see a flicker of 'was I THAT emotional?' cross his face!

The makeup used on Sean Kenney, the 'substitute' Captain Pike (Jeffery Hunter was unavailable),might be some of the best ever done for any Trek: it holds up totally through repeated cuts back and forth from the pilot footage: you are totally convinced this is an older, horribly maimed Jeffrey Hunter! 

Some small parts of The Cage are cut: some shots of Pike's fellow 'zoo-mates', some VERY sexist lines about 'women on the bridge', and the obligatory 'aliens running through the computer' scene. None of these are very important to the plot of EITHER the pilot or the envelope. 

And just to add some trivia: 

Part II of The Menagerie was the highest rated episode of Star trek ever in prime time! 

Actor Malachi Throne had been the original voice of the Talosian Keeper in the pilot. Since he was cast as Commodore Mendez, voice artist Vic Perrin was dubbed in as The Keeper.

As per the Director's Guild, Marc Daniels was credited as director for Part I, while the director of The Cage, Robert (Mr Pilot) Butler, was given the screen credit for Part II.

The Menagerie is amazing experience from start to finish!

 	In the movie Some Like It Hot its a great movie and its genre is comic and lovely.It takes place in Chicago and in Forida.This movie is about two musicians that accidentallywitness a gangland shooting and then they the other people wanted to killed them. Morover they two musicians Joe(Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon)decide to go to Florida to participate to a girl jazz band. The problem is that they cannot go as boys so they decide to dress themselves as girls and to present themselves as JOsephine and Daphne. in they way to Forida they meet a lverlorn singer that is Marilyn MOnroe.Their plan is perfect until  Josephine falls in love with Marilyn Monroe. Then at the same time a old man falls in love with daphne and wants to engage her.

One conflict that the movie has is when the old man tries to engage daphne but she told hin that they can't marrie and she gievs a lot of excuses to him and he says that it doesn't matter that he would forgive her. in addition at the end she says to him that she is a man and he asnwers him that is ok that nobody is perfect. I think that was a good conflict because eventhough she try to get away with it he accepts her without having a problem.The usual is that he wouldn't accept her bor being a man, but that didnt matter to him.

The character in this movie are really good actors all of them had a great actuation.The only thing that was different is that the gangster got killed and i think they didnt have a good acting. all the sets wre good except for the one that i just talk about. The lightning in the movie was very creative it was very good, the costumes wre really nice and everyone dressed great in the movie.

The music the movie has was ok too because it goes with the type of the movie.

 	This film was absolutely beautiful because of the location in which it was shot and the main characters.

745,"	Review of 3 Games to Glory III
 	Introduction

3 Games to Glory III is a two-disc video compilation of the 2004 New England Patriots playoffs, including their Super Bowl victory over the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 in Super Bowl XXXIX.  This Super Bowl victory was the Patriots third in four years, marking them as the team of `00s.  For New England Patriots fans it's a chance to relive the glory of back-to-back Super Bowl victories and three championships in four years.  Non-New England Patriots fans probably would not particularly enjoy this in-depth video. 

Main Features

3 Games to Glory III provides extensive highlights of both New England Patriots' playoff wins and Super Bowl victory after the 2004 season.  

These playoffs found New England once again schooling the Indianapolis Colts in yet another year where Peyton Manning and the vaunted Colts offensive choke under playoff pressure.  The high flying Colts offense was throttled by the superior schemes and tough play of the Patriots in a 20-3 AFC Divisional Playoff win at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. 

This is followed by New England's dramatic defeat of the Pittsburgh Steelers, 41-27, in the AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.  The Patriots entered this game as decided underdogs to the 15-1 Steelers after being throttled by Pittsburgh earlier in the season.

Finally, you get to enjoy the extensive highlights of New England's impressive 24-21 win over the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles.  This is yet another game where New England's superior execution and stamina in the later stages of the game brought them ultimate glory.  The Super Bowl was played in Jacksonville, Florida on February 6, 2005.

The highlights of each game are very extensive and seem to cover nearly every play.  They are also mostly well done, but frankly the highlights often fail to capture the real drama of the game.  Of course no highlight reel can match the excitement and drama of a live contest, but there are times when key turning points of the game really just become another quick hit in the video.  

There are a few disappointments in this video though and it's not quite as well done as the preceding 3 Games to Glory II (covering the Patriots playoff run and Super Bowl victory after the 2003 season).  First, there is not as much pre-game drama and preparation presented in these videos compared to last year.  Secondly, there are not as many close up, on the field shots that bring the game right into your living room.  It's much more distant and not as close up as previous editions in this series.

Despite these drawbacks, it's still great to relive a great season through these videos.

Bonus Features

The bonus features on this edition of 3 Games to Glory are not nearly as good as the ones on 3 Games to Glory II.  The bonus features are nice they just didn't live up the standard in the previous edition.  Following is a brief rundown of what you'll get on the DVD.

There are some ""Bill Belichick"" breakdowns of key plays for each game but there are very few of them and really leaves the viewer wanting more.  

There's also a ""Points After: Sounds of the Game"" which shows post-Super Bowl press conference features, but again, it's really short and leaves you wanting more.

The ""Patriot's All Access"" which appears along with each of the playoff and Super Bowl wins shows locker room scenes and practices, team meetings, and other shots of players as they prepare for games.  These are pretty well done short features that add a great deal to the video.  

The ""All Access"" section for the Super Bowl of course included pre-game plane trip, post game party and the parade.  I find these a bit boring frankly, but I guess it's nice to see the players up close on their daily routines.

The Super Bowl Highlights are shown twice, once with the regular commentary and once with commentary from Rosevelt Colvin (LB), Ted Johnson (LB), and Matt Light (T).  Matt Light is a funny guy and this was more entertaining than the one last year.

I thought the best bonus feature was one on Disc Two called ""Views from the Past"" with interviews with three great players from previous decades - Gino Cappelletti of the 1960's, Michael Haynes of the 1970's, and Andre Tippett of the 1980's and 1990's.  This conversation was mostly about comparing this current Patriots' team with teams of the past and how the game has changed over the decades.

Finally, the video has the 2005 playoff roster, Super Bowl stats, and 2005 game by game results - just like you can get in any book, it just shows it printed on the screen.

Overall, while all these bonus features are nice, 3 Games to Glory III is not nearly as good as 3 Games to Glory II.  It did not include an extensive behind the scenes segment on the Super Bowl, which I found fascinating on the previous edition, nor did it have highlights for each game of the regular season like the previous edition.  I found the lack of these too items very disappointing as I thought they were outstanding editions to last year's disc.  

Nevertheless, the bonus features overall are nice, just nice as nice as last time.

Bottom Line

All New England fans should enjoy reliving a third Super Bowl win through this highlights package.  It's mostly well done and certainly brings back great memories of a great season.  Those who are not Patriots fans I am sure would find the video quite boring.

Disclaimer:  I am a die hard New England Patriots fan and am totally biased in this review
",1,"3 Games to Glory III is a compilation of two CDs of videos of the 2004 New England Patriots playoffs, including their Super Bowl victory over the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 in Super Bowl XXXIX. That Super Bowl win was the Patriots' third in four years and marked them as the team of the year. For New England Patriots fans, it's a chance to relive the glory of Super Bowl victories and three championships in four years. Non-fans of the New England Patriots probably wouldn't particularly enjoy this in-depth video. Main features 3 Games to Glory III features extensive highlights of both the New England Patriots' playoff victories and the Super Bowl victory after the 2004 season. In those playoffs, New England coached the Indianapolis Colts again in another year in which Peyton Manning and the much-vaunted Colts offense suffocated under playoff pressure. The Colts' overflying offense was throttled by the Patriots' superior systems and hard play in their 20-3 playoff victory in the AFC Divisional at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. It follows the New England Patriots' dramatic 41-27 loss in the AFC Championship Game to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Patriots went into that game against the Steelers as the determined underdog, having been throttled by Pittsburgh earlier in the game. Finally, enjoy the full highlights of New England's impressive 24-21 victory over the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles. This is another game in which the superior execution and perseverance of New England in the later stages of the game brought them ultimate glory. The Super Bowl was held on February 6, 2005 in Jacksonville, Florida. The highlights of each game are very extensive and seem to cover almost every game. They are mostly well done, but frankly the highlights often fail to capture the real drama of the game. Of course, no highlight reel can match the excitement and drama of a live competition, but there are times when the game's key turning points really just become another quick hit in the video. There are a few disappointments in this video, though, and it's not quite as well done as the previous 3 Games to Glory II (about the Patriots playoff run and Super Bowl victory after the 2003 season)."

 	If you can get through David's boot camp video with moderate effort, this video may be a bit too easy for you.  That said, this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser.  David does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form.  He is very encouraging throughout.  The workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used (two dumbbells needed).  There are a few innovative moves thrown in as well.  

Since the difficulty level of any workout video is relative, I'll give a quick background of myself - I run 4-5 times a week, for a total of 40+ miles/week.  I also lift weights 2-3 times a week, incorporating plyometrics and compound movements.  I've personally found David's boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using 5-lb dumbbells and think this one-on-one video is great for days I have less energy.  Regardless of fitness level, you are sure to enjoy this workout.  If you need to make it more intense, use heavier weights.  The biggest thing to remember about David's style (in my opinion) is to really *focus* on every repetition, *focus* on the muscle being worked, and *focus* on isometrics (contracting the muscle without movement - eg. pushing against a brick wall is isometric).  Hope this helps

749,"	Wow. Still, Wow
 	I was reading some reviews of ""The Quiet Man"" earlier this year. And a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time, entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children, grandchildren and I imagine great grandchildren.

In that league of the timeless you have to put Ben-Hur, a story of love, redemtion, compassion, revenge, retribution, foregiveness and tranquility, in an epic truly larger than life. If we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago, then certainly William Wyler's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view.

For me, seeing it again and again, I am always startled by Mr. Heston's skills as an actor, often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence. Here the antagonist is Stephen Boyd, Judah Ben-Hur's best friend from childhood, now addicted to the narcotic of power. The two will clash; this is the time of Christ's ministry. Christ is seen as a rabble rouser and Rome, an international giant the world had never seen, seeks to thwart that message by girding up Jerusalem. So they send the now goal oriented and vicious Messala to the home of Ben-Hur.

Heston is also supported ably by Jack Hawkins, a brilliant actor in his prime, as the Roman Counsel Quintus Arrius. Judah Ben-Hur, sentenced to virtual death on the Roman Galleys, survives a battle with the Macedonians to only save Quintus Arius. 

I say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene, the arrival of Quintus Arrius in Rome, a hero, with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman, Judah Ben-Hur. William Wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as Jack Hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before Ceasar there must be 100 steps! And the camera back away to see Hawkins in his magenta robe, draped over the pure white stairs, climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire. In ""Spartacus,"" also a fine movie a few years later, the script tells you about the size of the Roman empire. Here in this one scene, Wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word.

At the same time, Judah Ben-Hur, remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs, looks around and in that one expression on Heston's face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century Rome, he amplifies the scene of Hawkins climbing the staircase.

A great, great move. Well worth your time if you have never seen it. Well worth your time again if you have. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur

756,"	Charming take on the children's story
 	Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, and over-sugary. However, I have been pleasantly surprised.

Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccarine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including ""12 Dancing Princesses,"" was significantly higher than I had expected. They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music. On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or The Queen of the Night's aria from Mozart's magic flute, and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.) 

The soundtrack to ""Twelve Dancing Princesses"" is mostly adapted from some of Mendelsohn's best work, including ""A Midsummer night's dream"" and the Scottish and Italian symphonies. It also includes a lullaby sung to the King by the 12 princesses which was based on a 16th century anthem by Byrd, the recording of which was sung beautifully by Melissa Lyons and the Women's Occidental Glee club.

The story is loosely based on the children's story. ""Barbie"" plays ""Princess Genevieve"", the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed King (e.g. seven young women, plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6.) Like the original, the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing, sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night. However, in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the King their father, who loves them very much, but his cousin, Duchess Rowena, who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor. At first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was ...

As with many of the Barbie films, comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters. In this case Princess Genevieve has a pet cat, and the evil Duchess Rowena has an equally evil pet monkey, Brutus. The hero, who in this version is the royal cobbler, Derek, has a pet parrot, who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated Indian accent. (That's Indian from the subcontinent, not native American.)

Those people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them. And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality, but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is, that is a concern with this film.

But on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. Alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring. And best of all, the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it's own

760,"	refreshing new Elvis musical
 	A fun musical comedy, THE TROUBLE WITH GIRLS isn't the usual Elvis Presley film but it's completely charming with it's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast.

Presley plays Walter Hale, manager of the traveling ""Chautauqua"" tent-show, circa. 1927, who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show.  Hale finds himself falling in love with Charlene (Marlyn Mason), organiser of the children's activities; whilst trying to help local single mother Nita Bix (Sheree North) when she murders her nasty married boyfriend (Dabney Coleman).  Presley's numbers include ""Swing Down Sweet Chariot"" and ""Clean Up Your Own Backyard"".

It's certainly a lot better than some of the other Elvis films from the same period; and seeing Elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat.  Marlyn Mason, probably one of Presley's most formidable leading-ladies, is stunning (and her rendition of ""Sign of the Zodiac"" is a knockout).  Nicole Jaffe (as the amorous hotel clerk), Vincent Price (eccentric speaker ""Mr Morality""), John Carradine (as a colourful Shakespearian actor), Joyce van Patten (disgruntled former channel swimmer Maude) and Edward Andrews (as Hale's beleaguered assistant) are also fine.

 	""Fargo"" is a very good film. The Cohen Brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film. The film stars Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) as a car salesman in dire need of money. When he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom, things go from bad to worse. I couldn't help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers. The father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom, and decides to act on his own. Jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess. Moreover, he has a saavy police chief (McDormand) on the case. 

The film is a definite black-comedy, as many of the Cohen brother's films are. This one is a bit more disturbing than usual however. Hot on the case is a policewoman, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand). She is witty and intelligent and knows something is not right. Steve Buscemi stars as one of the kidnappers, and his partner has a few loose marbles. The film is a delightful [at times funny] film that is highly recommended. Moreover, there are many colorful and funny character actors in the film, which only enhance the films appeal. There are also some disturbing scenes, however, the film is well worth the watch and purchase. Highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5

763,"	This is a great movie, seems alot of people who have reviewed it can't enjoy something that isn't Hollywood sanctioned
 	I thought the film was great, it has a interesting storyline. It also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on.

I don't understand why people will rate this movie so low. Is it cuz it doesn't have a pre-Hollywood established actress/actor in it? That it isn't some mainstream unoriginal film, which even the most moronic of morons can grasp?

Listen don't rate this movie low if it doesn't seem good to you, because it requires thinking unlike the mainstream cookie-cutter films in the theaters. You stay to your pablum un-original mainstream films, and leave those people who work hard on indie films alone.

For the people who complained the girls were dressed too little, I've seen many more hollywood films where women wear nothing but string bikinis basically. These girls were dressed for a majority of the film.

For the person who said Ashley was ""plump"", you must really like your women to be Anorexic

765,"	A damn good picture...and what's wrong with it being slow?
 	I think this is a great film.  Many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it's running time (128 minutes), insisting it's too slow.  Almost ALL of Clint's films (the ones he's directed) run long.  The running times range from just over 2 hours to just under 3 hours (the longest being Bird, at 2 hours, 40 minutes).  Sure, the film isn't PC, but it was made in 1975, when you didn't have to be PC.  But there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on...the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film.  These are nervewracking and incredibly authentic.  Clint did all his own stunts in these sequences, and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences.  And they are very intense to watch, because you know the actors are really up there.  No CGI in those days.  This is one of the reasons they work so well.  CGI looks fake anyway.  It makes movies seem like cartoons.  People know it isn't real.  CGI reliance should be reduced in Hollywood, as it takes the tension out of action scenes. 

Check this film out.  It's worth all of its 128 minutes.

766,"	look out chan  and  li - here comes jaa
 	Recently realizing that Jackie Chan and Jet Li are about done with movie making for the most part, I always wondered if there was anyone who could take over.  Chan and Li are one of a kind and the best out there.  Fortunately, Tony Jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own.  The first thing I like about Tony Jaa is he is an expert in Muay Thai fighting, something new and original for the good guy in a movie.  The next thing I like is that he fights like Jet Li and does stunts like Jackie Chan, though once again he adds his own originality quite often.  

Ong Bak is pure action excitement - don't expect a deep story and do expect horrible English dubbing that is just down right annoying (you can still switch to subtitles with Thai spoken if desired).  If these 2 things don't matter to you, this movie just plains rocks.  Its a bit slow here and there, but overall it is filled with all the action you could want - illegal club fights, an incredible club brawl fight, tons of stunts and chases, a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars, a ring fight, and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts, lasting for a good 10 minutes.  I also liked the background music for the movie - lots of smooth laid-back hip hop beats.

I'm pleased to say that with newcomer Tony Jaa to the world of martial arts films, the loss of Chan and Li someday soon won't be as bad.  Ong Bak is brilliant action and originality. The only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing, which Chan and Li movies do much better

 	This DVD was better than I could have asked for. It uses footage from the tv show This Week In Baseball [TWIB], and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of America's Pastime. It goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including Tim Hudson, Ryan Dempster, select Phillies players,  and  many others, as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as Tommy Lasorda and Yogi Berra. If you love TWIB's ""How 'Bout That"" section of the show, you will adore this DVD.

As far as I can tell, every major league team is shown, though some have the spotlight on them more than others. This is a must have for any baseball fan. It's by far one of the best MLB DVDs released in a long time.

 	This is a sad little gem of a movie.  I really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love. The story had as much to do with issues of identity, community, and fidelity.  In my opinion, there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved, especially when considering the quality of the performances.  The slight quiver in Weisz's voice was right on target as was Perez's accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable. Considering the type of story and the setting, I can't help but think that a three-part mini-series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film.  I emerged from watching the movie with a feeling  that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character

The stories in this show were so amazing and so well done, that I couldn't help myself when I became hooked on the show, and I was only four-years-old when this show debuted with its first season back in 1989.

     TALES FROM THE CRYPT takes you on a journey through six horrifying episodes, each one scaring you in one way or another. This here first season only includes six episodes, but all six are very terrifying, and many ways, rather comical as well.

But now, a law has been passed to ban the life sentence, for even executing murderers and law breakers is ""Still Murder Within The Eyes of God"". Niles then appears in a few court cases where the defendants happen to be let off the hook, despite the fact they are indeed guilty. This leaves Niles to privately execute the defendants, where it leads Niles into his own arrest, where is then in for a ""Shocking"" surprise.

The news has even stated that the patient has been seen wearing a Santa Claus suit, a suit he had stolen from one his victims. The mental patient stumbles upon this woman, practically killing her, but she seems to have killed him by stabbing him in the stomach. As she gets a hold of the police on the phone, she is told by the police to look around for a weapon to use, since she has informed the police that the patient has gotten up and entered her house, after she stabbed him the stomach. She goes into the closet to get her gun, but the door locks. As she pounds on the door, trying to get out, the patient climbs up to the woman's daughter's bedroom, with the daughter thinking that's it the real Santa.

The surgery goes successful, where Ulric becomes a classic act at the county fairs. He has been drowned, shot in the heart with an arrow, electrocuted, and many more. But he just kept coming back from beyond the grave. Here is now about to pull his next death stunt: being buried alive for twelve hours, and then resurrected. But...wait a minute.

776,"	Straight Up!
 	Visually  and  aurally this is a feast!  Great musicianship, excellent lighting, colour, camera angles etc etc.   If you know  and  like Pat  and  know the piece you won't be really disappointed BUT the reason it's 4*  and  not 5* for me is a combination of 2 things relatively insignificant in themselves but together worth knocking off a star.  First, there's no intro (the first note is struck with the title screen still showing)  and  no pictures of the band standing  and  taking the crowd's ovation (the credits start rolling straight after the last note);  I always find it nice to get a sense of the atmosphere, location  and  occasion before AND after the music starts playing.  Second, those familiar with the piece will be aware of the extraordinary guitar/trumpet interplay closing out Part Two; well, I'm not sure if this is in the playing or sound on the night or the dvd mixing but as the sound builds the trumpet dynamic gets a bit lost  and  all you really hear as an individual voice is the guitar synth - great of course but could've been even better!  This said, 4* for a Pat product still means a ""must buy""!

Second, anyone familiar with the piece will be aware of the extraordinary interplay between guitar and trumpet that closes Part Two; well, I'm not sure if that's in the game or the sound of the night or in the DVD's mixing desk, but when the sound builds up the trumpet dynamics, something gets lost and you hear the guitar synthesizer as a single voice - great of course, but it could have been even better! 4 * for a Pat product still means a ""must""!"
777,"	Anthony Hopkins sets the standard
 	'The Bunker' is one of three films that deal with Hitler's final days as the Soviets encircle Berlin and put an end to the Third Reich in April/May 1945.

'The Bunker' is both one of the best and one of the worst of the three (the others being 1973's 'Hitler: the last ten days' and 2005's 'Downfall') at the same time.  The triumph of 'The Bunker' is Anthony Hopkins tour de force performance as Hitler, at times so exact it is as if you are watching a newsreel.  The element that makes the film almost painful to watch is that almost a 1/3 of it is dedicated to the whitewashing of convicted Nazi war criminal Albert Speer.

One thing that makes 'The Bunker' different from the others is the occasional use of flashbacks, and although brief they do allow Hopkins to portray Hitler in different venues and in a relaxed mode, casually chating and enjoying the company of friends when times were fat.  In the bunker itself Hopkins turns Hitler purple in a full throttle rage as he yells about the need to destroy ""the scourge and pestilence of Jewish Marxism!""

'Hitler: the last ten days' does a bit better than the rest in portraying the supporting cast of characters in the drama but one stands out in 'The Bunker' and that is Michael Lonsdale as Martin Borman, Hitler's personal secretary and gatekeeper, a man of considerable power who plays his cards close to the vest and is always scheming to stay one step ahead of his rivals.  Despite its flaws 'The Bunker' earns a high rating as the Hopkins performance simply cannot be missed.

 	Bergman first introduced us to Johan and Marianne in his 1974 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage, one of the cinema's most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect.  Bergman and the splendid Scandanavian actors Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann took us through Johan and Marianne's marriage, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliation.  In the end, they live apart, but still make room for the bond between them. 
 
Three decades later, Bergman, Josephson and Ullmann have given us Saraband, a late-life gift.  Marianne decides that even though she hasn't seen Johan since the 1970s, it's time to make contact again.  Johan has inherited money from an aunt, and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake.  She literally wakes him with a kiss, but soon enough Marianne's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in Johan's family.

Henrik, Johan's son, is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter Karin.  Both of them still mourn Anna, Henrik's wife and Karin's mother, who died two years before.  Henrik, a music teacher, is preparing Karin, an accomplished cellist, for her conservatory entrance exams.  The elderly Johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic (not unlike Bergman's own father) and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him.  Henrik wants his father's affection and acceptance, even though Johan refuses to give it, ostensibly due to some slight by Henrik when he was 19 years old.  In a painful scene, Henrik goes to Johan to ask for money to help Karin, and in his 61 year old face, we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father.

For Karin, her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father.  Karin struggles to figure out what she owes Henrik, what she owes to the memory of her mother, and what she owes to herself.  She lets Marianne see some, but not all, of the turmoil she's going through.  For Marianne, her attraction to Johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him.  She's always wanted something from him, but since she can't define what it is, she'll probably never get it.

The struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by Marianne's opening and closing monologues.  Karin makes her choices.  Henrik reacts.  Marianne throws herself once more against Johan's emotional aloofness.  As he's done throughout his brilliant career, Bergman brings it alive through artful dialog, perfect dramatic timing, and riveting cinematic composition.  The characters are not always likable, but they are never less than engrossing.

The Criterion's DVD includes a mini-documentary of Bergman making Saraband.  We watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking, kid around with the crew, poke and prod his actors into position.  It's a treat to watch him work.  One wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from Julia Dufvenius, the fine young actress who plays Karin.  One also wonders why Bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he'd announced he was through.  

Bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection.  Apparently he wants to say one last thing about it, which seems to be this:  after all the tears and shouting, all the posturing and cruelty, all the reaching out and pulling back, this is what remains:  marriages of true minds (the photo of Anna used in the film is a picture of Bergman's great love, his deceased wife Ingrid); the fraught ties of fathers and sons; memories of old loves; what you give and get from children; and the devolution of the flesh.  None of it is easy, the master tells us, but all of it is necessary.  In the end, it's all you have.

What's truly sad is that Bergman, sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey, claims that he's done.  He did for film what Shakespeare did for theater, took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving.  He will certainly be missed and he can't be replaced.

But don't see Saraband for nostalgic reasons.  It's a moving, insightful film that deserves a place in the director's canon.  Saraband stands on its own, but it's a deeper experience if you watch Scenes from a Marriage first.

780,"	Truffaut's Classic Relationship Triangle as Idiosyncratic, Disconcerting and Mesmerizing as Ever
 	The enduring legacy around Franï¿½ois Truffaut's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from Henri-Pierre Rochï¿½ semi-autobiographical novel. And in showing that elusive rapport, Oskar Werner, Henri Serre and especially Jeanne Moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the French New Wave. Fortunately, the two-disc Criterion Collection DVD set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic, although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times.

The story focuses on the friendship between two writers, an Austrian named Jules and a Frenchman named Jim, kindred spirits who enjoy a decadent lifestyle in pre-WWI Paris. Inspired by a statue of a woman's face with a most enigmatic smile, they agree that they are destined to fall in love with a woman with the same smile. Enter Catherine, as seductively capricious a free-spirit as ever there was in cinema, and the two men are instantly enamored. Jules is intent on marrying her, even though it's clear from the outset that she is not one who could commit for the long term. The war intercedes, and the two friends are fighting on opposite sides. After the war, Catherine, married to Jules and raising their young daughter, is emotionally dissatisfied and embarks on an affair with Jim. With Jules' blessing, things are idyllic for a while, but Jim proves too much the alpha male to defer to Catherine's whims, and the resulting imbalance leads to increasingly dramatic consequences.

In just his third film, Truffaut's trademark style emerges with fast cuts between scenes and naturalistic camera movements (courtesy of Raoul Coutard's fluid cinematography). Moreover, George Delerue's animated music score and Michel Subor's voiceover add to the evocative photo-album memory atmosphere. At times, the storyline feels a bit disjointed, but the fulsome performances more than compensate. Werner fully captures the internal struggle within Jules in attempting to reconcile his love for Catherine with her impossible demands on him. Serre has the comparatively more objective role but convincingly shows his character surrendering to the tangled situation. After her impressive turn as an obsessed adulterer in Louie Malle's ""Elevator to the Gallows"", Moreau solidifies her vaunted reputation here, conveying Catherine's petulance and unyielding passion in a vividly mercurial fashion.

The DVD extras are abundant starting with two commentary tracks. The first one, a more factual account of the production, was recorded in 1992 with Truffaut collaborator Suzanne Schiffman, editor Claudine Bouche, co-screenwriter Jean Gruault, and scholar Annette Insdorf. The second, produced in 2000, is far better as it has Moreau sharing her personal recollections of the filming with Truffaut biographer Serge Toubiana. Disc One also includes a brief 1966 interview with Truffaut discussing Rochï¿½ and a 1985 featurette, ""The Key to Jules and Jim"", which contains interviews with the author's friends as they discuss the inspirations for the characters. Disc Two takes a broader look at Truffaut with five separate interviews with the director over the span of fifteen years, as well as insightful interviews with Coutard and co-screenwriter Jean Gruault

781,"	It's A Real Cool World
 	I'll tell ya... if I read one more review written by someone born after 1980 dissing Bakshi, I think I'm going to start kicking rump and taking names. Do people diss Disney? Hardly, until they became such a movie mill that they are computer generating what used to be created by hand with a loving touch.

Look at ""Cool World"" as the AntiToonworld of ""Roger Rabbit"". The characters are psychedelic, psychotic, retro and bent. There is a great deal of (expected) sexuality and lewdness, pushing the edge of the PG-13 as far as it can go. Lots of puns and inside jokes it takes an adult to appreciate, something Warner Bros. cartoons were masters at. Granted, they don't always hit the mark here, and there's more chemistry when the Doodles are on than when the Noids take over.

But I dare anyone to watch that scene with Holli cooing ""Let's Make Love"" to a sweating Mel Torme wannabe while she's having trouble keeping her Noidness intact and not feel the simulataneous urge to salivate and giggle. The transformation of Noids to Doodles when the wand is removed is humorous... a lounge lizard literally becomes one, a cowboy becomes a horse, a female lead a blank eyed Orphan Annie. 

The end cap, where Byrne's character becomes a dim witted but sincere superhero, is happily reminiscent of Captain Sternn from ""Heavy Metal"". 

Yes, the acting is practically phoned in. Yes, the plot is odd. But get over it, folks, it's adult animation, and it's entertaining. I watch it again and again... and I always laugh

784,"	A better film than the first, however...
 	Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting. 

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.  

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.

 	Old Boy is the second film in the Revenge Trilogy by Park. The first is Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and the final being Sympathy for Lady Vengeance.

After being imprisoned for 15 years, Ho Dae-su (whose name means ""getting along with everybody"") is released and finds he only has 5 days to find his captor and seek his revenge. Once the captor is found, Dae-su will learn about a past he conveniently forgot and find he is in for an even bigger surprise during the final confrontation.

The film is mesmerizing, hypnotic, and well edited with flashbacks and jump cuts. Park makes an elevator ride feel like a roller coaster. There is a notable fight sequence referred to as the ""one-take corrider scene"" where Dae-su takes several men in mostly hand-to-hand and hammer-to-head combat.

This is a powerful film. It is a meditation on our addiction to TV, the bloody thirst for revenge, and the tomfoolery your mind resorts to when it is forced to relive your memories. The film will make you question the importance of forgetting, forgiving, and the satisfaction, or lack there of, in seeking revenge.

The movie has an incredible build leading up to the finale. The end scene is full of twists. You will be amazed and you watch the truth slowly unravel. You learn that one memory is not as it appears and that another more important memory holding the key to the puzzle was completely forgotten. You will learn that getting the revenge is not the most important thing, but instead be able to live with yourself is. You will find that neither man will be able to do so, which leads to an explosive ending. There is also a bizarre, if not disgusting, love story at the center of this.

Favorite Quote: Too many good ones to mention. It is a tie between ""Be it a grain of sand or a rock - They both sink"" and ""Revenge is good for your health, but Pain will find you again.""

DVD Extras: Commentary, Multiple Deleted Scenes, Interview with director, Still Gallery, and Trailers from Tartan Asia Extreme.

Bottom Line: You will be entranced while following the plot and pleasantly shocked the surprise ending. I will be seeking out Park's other work as well and I suggest you do the same.

Rating: 8.5/10

 	The tale starts out with a historical reference to Chaucer.  For a fraction you wonder if you are watching the film you expected. And then you see the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger eagle that transitions us form mid-evil times to present day (1944) England.

Time is taken to give depth and background to all the main characters by the use of interactive dialog. We find that each brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury:

U.S. Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (U.S. Sergeant John Sweet) on his way to Canterbury mistakenly gets off in the hamlet of Kent. He is accused of having his stripes on upside down.

British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed at Kent while staging for overseas. He was and theater organ player before the war.

Alison Smith (Sheila Sim) a London store clerk before the war is now seeking a job as a `Land Girl'. She seems to have an uncanny knowledge of Kent and the Pilgrims' road to Canterbury.

The night they got off the train at Kent they had a strange encounter with the mysterious ""Glue Man"".  Then befriended by the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Mr. Colpeper is interested in the history of the Pilgrims' Road from Kent to Canterbury.

Until you get pretty much through this story you are never really sure where they are trying to take you.  Is the focus on a local mystery? The interaction of the players or the lives of the characters themselves?

",1,"Beware the glue man The story begins with a historical reference to Chaucer. For a fraction of the price, you wonder if you're watching the film you expected. And then you see Michael Powell and the Emmerich Brassburger Adler, who carry us from the middle of the bad times to present-day England (1944). The use of interactive dialogues takes time to lend depth and background to all the main characters. We find that each of them brings different technical skills and interpretations of the road to Canterbury: US Army Sergt. Bob Johnson (USA) Sergeant John Sweet) got off the train in Kent on his way to Canterbury. He is accused of turning his stripes upside down. British Sgt. Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price) is temporarily stationed in Kent while he directs overseas. He was and is an organist before the war. Alison Smith (Sheila Sim), a pre-war saleswoman in a London shop, is now looking for a job as a ""country girl."" She seems to have an eerie knowledge of Kent and the Canterbury pilgrimage route. The night they stepped off the train in Kent, they had a strange encounter with the mysterious ""glue man."" Then befriended the local judge Thomas Colpeper, JP (Thomas Colpeper, JP). Colpeper is interested in the history of the pilgrimage route from Kent to Canterbury."

 	This documentary is very concise, and very straight forward.  It does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir.  It features interviews with some very credible sources, all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic.  I really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together.  This documentary makes a great point and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics

793,"	Excellent, insightful, troubling, beautiful, inspiring....
 	One of the best movies I have seen!!! The subject itself forces you to look at your own limitations on anything that is out of your 'normal' boundaries. After watching this movie, you have a better insight on how limited most of us are and how this causes a lot more harm than we think it does.
In terms of film quality, it is also one of the best I have seen. The actors are tremendous, the characters are so accurately portrayed that you actually feel the pain of each one of them. Of course, Ludovic's innocence is rendered beautifully, but the changes that the mother goes through are very emotionally charged (maybe because I am a mother myself???). She seems at first to be the most understanding of all when it comes to her son's differences, then goes through a confusion stage, and then tries really hard to understand him. But when her family's whole life setting (house, husband's job, social life) goes havoc, she closes down emotionally on her own son which is extremely painful to watch. After one final emotionally violent confrontation with Ludovic, she realizes that she's loosing him and finally sees him the way it should be: her beautiful child, nothing more, nothing less.
It is also filmed in a very colorful manner (especially during Ludovic's escapes into dreamland), which accentuate the notion of Ludovic's innocence. The neighborhood setting seems to be a bit of a caricature of American suburbia (green front lawns, barbecue parties) with an European flavor (adults dancing at neighborhood parties). In any case, the movie seems to make a clear statement that intolerance seems to be most prominent in middle-class white surburban populations, which many could find this to be a bit of a stereotype.
In any case, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants something more out of movie than what is presented in mainstream movies.

 	I spent ten years working various scenes at the Trinity Church Hellhouse.  Yes, it is a bit campy, and yes, it is often over the top, but I can say that the people are well intentioned, just a bit off target.  I attended Trinity Church from birth until I was 22 years old.  I do not attend their anymore because of the close-minded attitude that is prevalant in this documentary.  I stopped doing HellHouse when they added the decision room my last year.  I just felt it was an un-biblical  scare tactic.  I now feel that way about the entire operation.  The worst feeling I get is knowing the young teenagers are blindly following the leadership without doing any research themselves.  I know because I was once one of them.  I have found that a growing number of former Trinity Youth Group members my age do not attend there for the same reasons I listed above.  This movie will open your eyes to the way teens are herded like cattle in fundamentalist Christian Churches.

797,"	One Time Just Isn't Enough
 	This is a movie you'll want to watch over again--a number of times for a number of reasons.  For one, you'll want to catch all the laughs that flew by too quick on the first go-round (perhaps the second and third go-round, too, and even beyond).  As the legend goes, with the exception of a few brief, well-timed breathers, director Howard Hawks has the actors assailing us with about 240 words for each of this film's sleek 92 minutes, with the jokes sometimes launched from multiple conversations at once.

I agree with the Amazon review: you'll also want to give the movie at least one look devoted exclusively to Cary Grant's performance as master-manipulator news chief Walter Burns.  One can only marvel at his hair-trigger, incendiary reactions to each situational development.  The big scoop involves the politically-driven gallows sentence of a meek little ""anarchist"" (John Qualen) alleged to have killed a black cop, and while ferociously tracking the story, Burns chats up and tries to reclaim his ace reporter, Hildy Johnson.

The movie is based on Hecht and MacArthur's long-running Broadway hit The Front Page.  An early talk-era version had been produced already for the silver screen, but Hawks decided his inspired idea of switching Hildy's gender to that of a woman justified another remake.  He was right: of the various stage and film renditions, His Girl Friday is regarded as the most powerful and effective use of the source material.

Handed this basic premise, scriptwriter Charles Lederer added one last layer of complexity: Hildy Johnson is not just any woman, but Walter Burns's ex-wife.  As the action begins, she is bidding the chaotic, cynical, wise-cracking reporter's life farewell, having decided to settle down and marry an insurance man named Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy, perfect as the earnest, slow-witted foil to Grant).

On hearing this, Burns hatches his plot.  If he can pull off the entire stunt, he will beat the competition to a story on local corruption.  By getting Hildy involved again, and helping her realize the Hawksian principle that ""you are what you do,"" he will also regain a writer of rare talent.  These two goals alone would be enough to keep his motivation interesting.  But of course the chance to win back his ex-wife brings a sexy tension to the frantic, lunatic action.

The one thing you have to do is reserve a viewing strictly for watching Rosalind Russell as Hildy.  In the part that literally no one wanted (Jean Arthur, Claudette Colbert, Irene Dunne and Carole Lombard all turned it down), Russell succeeds in making His Girl Friday her movie.  Among her colleagues in the press room (played by a sterling ensemble of character actors), she's got the hard-nosed wit to sound right at home with the boys.  At the same time, she stands out--not just in her bold pinstriped outfits, but with her unflagging dedication to the raw, key-punching grind of the professional ""news man.""  When necessary she dashes from telephone to telephone, one raging conversation to the next, yet in the movie's moment of high pathos, she manages to be absoltuely riveting while barely raising her voice above a whisper.  Finally, of course, her kinetic scenes with Grant are what earn this movie its reputation as one of the fastest, funniest zingers ever produced.

My sole warning: fork over the dough for Columbia's authorized release.  The cheap-o's--and there are several on the market--are pretty shabby in terms of image and sound quality.  With so much re-watching in your future, do what it takes to get the best version

804,"	NOT A BAD FILM AT ALL
 	There were loads of Swords  and  Sorcery films coming out in the 80's, most of them low budget garbage.  But this was actually one of the better films.  It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable.  Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant.  Pretty standard stuff.  But it's exectuted well.  The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard's Conan Story ""The Hour of the Dragon"" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer.  In the Conan story the sorcerer's name was Zaltotun.  In this movie, the name is Xusia.  Mere coincidence?  I think not.  But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll (of Night Court fame).  He's suitably imposing and evil, as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life.  Unfortunately Xusia doesn't get enough screen time.

Lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here, too.  Horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by Errol Flynn in Robin Hood than by Conan.  He's a fun-loving reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne.  He is eventually captured and Cromwell has him nailed to a cross, although it's an ""X"" cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism.  Again, this is a scene lifted from a Conan story ""A Witch Shall be Born"" when Conan was nailed to a cross.  Only Conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while Talon, actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately.  Now, I'm no doctor but I'm guessing that someone who had a 4"" nail driven through their palms is NOT going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but, ok, it's fantasy so I'll buy it.

Still, despite some shortcomings, this is an enjoyable little diversion.  The ending Credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized

It has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams.

My small gripes are that for some reason Naruto has the catch phrase of ""Believe it!"", and it gets dropped into places that it doesn't make any sense, but it's a small problem.

Also the extras you get are really fun and high quality. This is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike

819,"	Entertaining Murder Mystery  and  Impressive Early Example of Noir Visual Style.
 	""I Wake Up Screaming"" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low-key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of ""noir"" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called ""mystery lighting""- in this film made in 1941, before the United States entered the War. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher, adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor, who moved the action to New York, gave it a flashback structure, and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre-War Hollywood that combines multiple genres: Mystery, romance, musical (the singing scene was cut), comedy, suspense, and psychological drama. But the suspense does dominate. 

When model and aspiring actress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is murdered, the police are quick to blame Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), a fight promoter who met Vicky when she was a waitress, introduced her to all the right people, and managed her ascent to glamour girl -until she left him for Hollywood. Vicky's down-to-earth sister Jill (Betty Grable) disapproved of her career choice but doesn't want to believe Frankie responsible for her death. The Assistant District Attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator (Elisha Cook, Jr.) at the Lynns' apartment building is the killer, but sadistic police detective Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) won't let up on Frankie, constantly harassing and threatening him, leaving Frankie little choice but to find the killer himself. 

""I Wake Up Screaming"" opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape. That got my attention. Then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station. Frankie Christopher is harshly lit with one lamp, surrounded by police officers in the shadows. Gorgeous, dramatic, low-key lighting. The faces of some characters, even Frankie, are sometimes completely blacked out. I don't know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it's deliberate. But it's daring. Everywhere we go in the station house, there are bars and shadows. The implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming. The police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic. This really surprised me in such an early film, but it's fabulous.

This was Betty Grable's first non-musical role. She's all sweetness and goodness, but she is also level-headed, practical, and brave in the mold of a film noir helper-heroine. Unfortunately, every time she appears on screen we hear ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"", which eventually drove me a little nuts. Victor Mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist. But the stand-out performance comes from Laird Cregar as the very creepy, obsessed police detective Cornell. He's truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains. The dialogue isn't hard-boiled except for a few lines delivered by Vicky. But ""I Wake Up Screaming"" is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering Hollywood's visual vocabulary. 

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006):  A few scenes show some white specks and lines, but this print is generally good. Sound is good. Bonus features: A deleted scene called ""Daddy"" (4 min), in which Betty Grable sings. This doesn't fit the tone of the movie well, so it was best left out. ""Hot Spot"" (text) is a brief account of the film's title change from ""I Wake Up Screaming"" to ""Hot Spot"" and back again. We can watch the opening credits for the film with the ""Hot Spot"" title (1 min). There are 3 ""Still Galleries"": A Poster Gallery (3 posters), a Production Stills Gallery of behind-the-scenes photos (8), and a Unit Photography Gallery of publicity stills (38 photos). It's interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself. There is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Film noir historian Eddie Muller delivers a good, nearly constant audio commentary. He compares the screenplay to Steven Fisher's novel, provides background information for many of the creative crew and actors, discusses the noir visual style and the juxtaposition of light and dark thematic elements in the film. Muller speaks a lot about the people involved in the film, as always. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish

820,"	A Cunning Coming-Out Charmer With a Trio of Winning Female Performances
 	First-time feature director/screenwriter Alice Wu's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it, but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling, unforced humor and a trio of winning performances. With a conflicted protagonist at its core, the film shares the same soufflï¿½-light rom-com territory as Ol Parker's half-hearted ""Imagine Me and You"" and Ian Iqbal Rashid's overly cute ""A Touch of Pink"". Wu, however, manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly, because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes.

The plot focuses on Wil, short for Wilhelmina, an obviously talented Manhattan-based surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional Chinese family living across the East River in Flushing. Referred to just as ""Ma"" in the story, her mother is a widowed beautician, who only speaks Mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her. Wil's eyes, nevertheless, are set squarely on a comely ballerina named Vivian, who happens to be the daughter of Wil's supervising surgeon at the hospital. Meantime, Ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home. Ma moves in with Wil, and the inevitable consequences ensue. There are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout, but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads.

As Wil, Michelle Krusiec is a terrific find, evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times. Lynn Chen is saucy and inviting as Vivian, though I wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue. Both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable, culminating in the inevitable girl-on-girl scene. Despite the beauty of her younger co-stars, Joan Chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character. Even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty, Chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties, making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning. Yet, she is able to convey the necessary brittle, distanced manner as Ma, making her character's self-discovery process more rewarding.

The ending is on the pat side, especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a wedged-in riff on ""The Graduate"", but it doesn't compromise the sweet-natured charm of the piece. Special mention should go to Harlan Bosmajian's cinematography, which captures the saturated colors found in the Chinese-American community. The 2005 DVD contains Wu's thoughtful commentary on a separate track, as well as several deleted scenes, a standard, ten-minute making-of featurette and a rather dull Sundance video diary

821,"	One of the most well done movies ever
 	Scenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman. To me, this is one of the best films ever. It not only captures a great story, but it is done so well.
What makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel, act, and generally take care of issues.
This isn't one of those American films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them.
In here, as he is telling his wife about this other lover, she is without emotions, just staring off, with no real reactions whatsoever, a way most would respond.
This is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is great/perfect. It is later that she finds outs that perhaps, the marriage isn't so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce.
There, the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage. He later says he's been with a woman for a while now, and shortly there after, leaves her.
After a year of so, they get together to sign the divorce papers, which turns out rough at the end.
After some time, they get together again, and in some way, fall in love once again, even though both are married to other people.
There, the movies ends.
Great film! Hard to watch some american films now, because most just seem horrible, and in ways, corny. I'm glad I got to see a great film like this.

823,"	an intellegent, unapreciated gem. starring my two favorite actresses Carla Gugino  and  Catherine Bell
 	Threshold starring Carla Gugino (Special guest Catherine Bell episode #11 Outbreak): 
i loved this show. i liked it when it was on CBS and i like it even more now that i got the dvd's with the unaired shows to at least try to bring it to some sense of a conclusion. 
Carla Gugino was very good (as usual)playing a strong woman named Dr. Molley Anne Caffrey a contingency analayst who's job it is to come up with worst case scenarios for any natural or man-made disaters. (earthquake,hurricanes, WWIII, epidemics, worldwide finacial depression) you get the picture. the one she is called upon for is for a scenario named ""Threshold"" (hence the name of the show). Threshold - is the contengency plan for alien invasion. her job is now to put the plan in motion. to quickly assemble a team made up of a physian, a mathmatican/linguist, an areonautics engineer and navy seal whose job it is to implement the orders she gives out usually via military force or other covert means and to protect the ""Red Team"". and asscess the threat and plan how to stop the threat. 
the actors who played the other members on Molly's team were all good and i believed and cared for them all. but this review is about Carla and Catherine so i will get to the point. 
Carla owned the show, she carried it off just like she did in ""Karen Sisco"" 
she told a great story and added importance to a very well done show. i really do believe she is one of the best and underrated actresses in the business today. and she was just stunningly beautiful. every time she was on camera you could not help but to focus on her. the camera loved her. the beauty made you look her way. but the acting, the way she carried herself. made you stay focused on her. 
Catherine Bell was on the episode ""Outbreak"" this episode was about about how Molly and her team discovered that one of the ways the aliens could spread and infect people was through the food supply. now they already knew this a few episodes before but, they thought they took care of it, but they were wrong. Molley needed to know exactly how they spread it, to what foods and how long did it take effect on people who ate it. so she basically drafted Catherine Bell and made her apart of the team whether she wanted to or not. 
Catherine Bell played Dr. Daphene Larsons. an expert on Botony and Biology. who figured out that some foods were more likely to get it and that it was mainly tomatos and food like it that they need to worry about. i'm afraid Catherine did not get much to work with here and she was only on it for that epsiode and only mentioned it the rest. i was told that had the show been picked up and went the next year she would have been a full blown cast member. 
But Catherine - like Carla - was stunningly beautiful. however she does not have the same presence as Carla does when she on camera. she did a good job - but she had next to nothing to work with and there was no essence within her or her character's personality that took over when you got over her looks as opposed to Carla when she was on. Carla was on her game and stayed on it. it was her show. Catherine did the best she could with what little she had, she was not on her game. but it wasn't her show. 
Carla and Catherine had really no interaction together. the only one they kinda had was when Molly was briefing Daphene on Threshold and the story thus far. and that was done with Daphine sitting in a chair looking confused and over-whelmed while Molly stood in front of her and explained it all. and it was all done using cross fade and fade in-outs edits. i appreciated the effects - nice touch - but i would have liked to see some real dialogue there. i'm pretty sure had there been an episode 14 they would have done something together like i don't know; kick some alien butt together or Kissed. 
in conclusion - i loved the show. then tension kept me going and seemed real. 
it wasn't neardy and though it was ScFi, i really did'nt get that feeling. there was more to the story, it was intellegently done and i wanted more. but they cancelled it. the last epsiode did however give it some closeuer so you don't feel too cheated buying one season of the show. it left you having enough questions as to where you wanted to see more, but, could still come up with your own conclusions. they ended it like they could add more to the story at a later date in a form of a movie or another show but if they never do. then i guess it is still okay. 
the show was supposed to last three years going in accordance to Molly's scernario: 
1. Threshold - we have spotted and accessed the threat. 
2. Foothold - they have established themselves on earth. we have notified the public and began to stop them by any means necessary. (Probably what season 2 would have been called. 
3. Stranglehold - if it get to this point it either means we have stopped them and sent them home or they have won and anhilated us. (Season three title i suppose.) 
she never came up with a 4th stage. i guess it would be pointless.

824,"	Potentially Promising; Hence Its Sudden Suffocation
 	CBS's THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science-fiction thriller; however regardless of it's interesting story premise, good acting, and well supported production team, it, like NBC's ""SURFACE"" and ABC's ""INVASION"", was cancelled.  Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars.

Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb?  Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube's ""reality"" shows and less than funny comedies.  

Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting?  Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters.  Sadly, they didn't have the opportunity to finish the job.

Was it cancelled because it didn't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes?  Arguably, but the team did offer some great visuals, interesting plotlines, and nightmare scenarios.

So why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated?  Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer doesn't appreciate a good story takes time to develop (The X-Files, Alias, 24, Law  and  Order, CSI, Smallville, Numbers, etc.).

Is it worth buying or renting? Yes.  Though a cancelled series, it has that one thing most of it's one season wonders don't have--an adequate conclusion that doesn't leave you wondering how a cliff-hanger is to be resolved

 	I've been encouraged by Pat Metheny's music since 1980... that's a long time to follow one guy's music track, but through it all he has always grown and done more than you would expect. His trio record set the standard in the early days, with Bright Size Life (w. Jaco and Bob Moses), and his PMG work has been unusual and different and refreshing. One reviewer mentions ""cheesy tunes"" - in what sense? In the sense that they don't conform to a rigid set of jazz sounds that we've come to expect (swing+sax+trumpet+upright bass + x y and z=jazz)? Great jazz musicians are innovators, and what PMG has done consistently through its life and continues to do is to create it's own genre of music unto itself - completely unique. Are you going to find 14 other groups sounding like this? No way. Not even one. I know cheesy music when I hear it, and there are plenty of so-called mainstream jazz artists that are guilty of it in addition to the usual suspects. Most jazz musicians will be remembered as that guy or gal that sounded kind of like Miles or kind of like Coltrane or Brecker or whatever. The great ones are the ones others are compared TO, and Pat Metheny falls in that category. 

If you are open-minded to creative music and want to enjoy great musicians at the top of their game, creating art together as a team listening well and bringing fresh new ideas to life, then buy or rent this DVD. If you want to hear what one kid from Missouri who was by age 15 determined to play with Gary Burton (and he did) was able to do with the guitar by just doggedly pursuing it year after year, creating fresh new material, taking the beauty of the guitar to new levels each and every year, then listen to this DVD and be a part of his history. Because Pat is one of the true geniuses of our age. His relationship with Lyle Mays persists to this day - what a story of loyalty working together though a lifetime.

And Pat is able to draw more talent out of his musicians than most bandleaders. A lot of jazz artists have used Richard Bona over the years as a talented fretless bass player, but Pat Metheny gave him a stage to share the whole range of his talent. He does a solo with himself and some percussion and a delay pedal that is amazing - he harmonizes with himself and creates a tapestry of sound... Cuong Vu did something similar on this DVD with his trumpet.

The drummer and bass player (Antonio Sanchez and Steve Rodby)are just on it - this is a great band. If you get a chance to hear their Austin City Limits performance, I think it is slightly better in the sense of how raw it is; this performance is more polished, and of course a lot more time was taken in the mastering of this. Both live performances are worth checking out.

In the sense that they do not stick to the rigid set of jazz sounds that we have come to expect (swing + sax + trumpet + double bass + x y and z = jazz)? Great jazz musicians are innovators, and what PMG has consistently done throughout its life and continues to do is create its own genre of music for itself - completely unique. Will you find 14 more groups that sound like this? Not at all. Not even one. I know cheesy music when I listen to it, and there are many so-called mainstream jazz musicians who are guilty of music alongside the usual suspects. Most jazz musicians will remember themselves as the guy or girl who sounded like Miles or somehow like Coltrane or Brecker or whatever. The big ones are the ones you compare others to, and Pat Metheny falls into that category. If you are open to creative music and want to enjoy great musicians at the top of their game, create art together while listening well and bring fresh new ideas to life, then buy or rent this DVD. If you want to hear what a kid from Missouri who decided to play with Gary Burton at the age of 15 (and he did) could do with the guitar, just persistently pursuing it year after year, creating new material, taking the beauty of the guitar to a new level every year, then listen to this DVD and become part of its story. Because Pat is one of the true geniuses of our time. His relationship with Lyle Mays continues to this day - what a life-long story of loyalty. And Pat is able to get more talent out of his musicians than most bandleaders."

829,"	Stott Fit and Firm
 	I've been doing Pilates for several months along w/ my daily Yoga practice and it's been an incredible and effective addition to my program!

 At this point I have collected about 17 Pilates programs (along w/ my 90 Yoga programs) and there are certain teachers that have shone above the rest. For me Moira Stott is one of those special teachers that has a way of communicating so clearly and putting together such sound practices that I always look forward to spending time with her programs.

 I had purchased the four DVD pack w/ ""Basics"", ""Fit and Firm"", ""Secret to Flat Abs"" and ""Sculpt and tone"", and just this morning did ""Fit and Firm"" for the first time. For someone brand new to Pilates I HIGHLY recommend the ""Basics"" DVD, it's the single best beginners DVD/VHS I've worked with since starting Pilates.

 As always Moira starts with detailed explanations and warm ups and with the help of a student who demonstrates beautifully, leads you through a wonderful, well paced pilates practice.

 This practice basically follows the intermediate Pilates series with some additional advanced poses added in as well. It's about  45 minutes long but flows so beautifully that the time really flies by.

 Some people find Moria Stott to be dry or boring, but I find her to be a pleasure to practice with. Perhaps because I'm from a Yoga background (daily for the past nine years) I'm used to teachers who are less ""rah rah"" (I also don't like blaring music when I'm practicing Yoga or Pilates)so Moira's approach fits me well. If you like teachers who have a more hyper ""in your face"" personality then this may not be a good fit for you. But if you want a teacher who knows her stuff and who will guide you in a way that is sound and effective then Moira Stott is someone you will truly appreciate on so many levels.


 Other teachers whose teaching style I really enjoy are Hilary Burnett (her Intermediate program is incredible) and Jennifer Kries. 

 I also like Ana Caban and Michelle Dozois for variety in my practice.

 Highly recommended!

 	Definitely a great movie, Rules of Engagement, brings to the screen two stories as they unfold simultaneously; that of a military investigation into whether an officer in the Marines was in violation of the code of conduct during an incident in Yemen, and the inner struggle of the investigator/defence lawyer as he tries to come to terms with his past and the ghosts that have been haunting him ever since Vietnam.... 
The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.
Needless to say, Tommy Lee Jones, Samuel Jackson, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!
The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful!
In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't already done so)!!  Strongly recommended along with Black Hawk Down, A Few Good Men, and Courage Under Fire.

 	I'd seen this film before, in a lesser unrestored edition, and wasn't that impressed. Sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be.

Thanks to Mike Nelson's biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood's last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.

(Okay, maybe I'm overrating Mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1-3, I think we'd be looking at pure marketing gold. C'mon Lucas, you know you can't resist any excuse to re-release yet another DVD version of your little sci-fi sextology. Give the man a call.

 	OK folks, this is by far one of the best DVDs I've bought in quite awhile. You get so much for so little. First you get the original black and white movie. Reefer Madness is like the Three Stooges, black and white just adds to its charm. But to see it in color is quite a hoot. The smoke is purple and pink, the suits and dresses are LOUD, and the color scheme for Mae's apartment is just mind boggling. What more could you ask for? Well you get more anyway.

When I discovered that Mike Nelson from MST3000 fame actually had narrating duty, I just had to buy Reefer Madness again. He's hilarious. Sure it would have been great for his two robot buddies to join in, but who knows, maybe someday. Mike was right on the ball and I laughed out loud quite a few times. I never noticed before how much time the dope dealer spent making meals and eating.

Well if that wasn't enough, we also get a short 15 minute film starring Grandpa Ganja. He's a marijuana expert who's been smoking pot for over 30 years. He quotes weed from the Bible, convincingly explains how Moses was a major dopehead, and also the disciples. Not only do we get an indepth history on marijuana, he demonstrates how to roll a joint, smoke a bong, and other helpful hints on how to administer medical THC. The old man is hilarious on helpful hints as to buying and growing your marijuana. When they showed the real old dude throwing marijuana seeds over his fence and then harvesting pot in his neighbor's yard I lost it. Low brow pot humor true, but in any case I laughed my butt off.

If you already have a black and white copy of Reefer Madness, it's worth buying again to have this edition. It's well worth it

 	Up until now, ""Basic Instinct"" has always been that little movie in pop culture in which Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs and exposes her vagina for an instant. After watching this movie, that is exactly what I'll remember it for. This movie is pop culture staple, it's stupid and impossible to predict. As soon as you think you've got it, you don't, only to discover you do; as we we see with the ending. The movie what critics refer to as ""a bad movie"".
And it is. However, people will forget ""Gandhi"" the Best Picture winner of 1980 something before they forget this movie. If you label your DVD collection, this would definitley be in the ""Guilty Pleasure"" section where you would also find movies like ""Wild Things"" and ""Cruel Intentions"". It's a movie that has big stars, a big budget, and a stupid story. But this all works perfectly. Oscar Winner Michael Douglas (Best Actor, Wall Street) plays Detective Nick Curran, an ex-alcoholic and smoker, who's investigating the murder of a former rock star. The person believed to have commited the murder is Catherine Tramell (Stone), a novelist who's novel has detailed the killing exactly. As Nick discovers more about the case, he finds simalar incidences involving Catherine and at the same time he begins an affair with her. Probably not the best thing to do when you're pretty damn sure she's killing people with ice picks. The movie is packed with cliches and occasional bad dialouge that is only annoying sometimes. Oddly enough, Douglas and Stone are perfect in their roles. Stone catches the feroscity, sexuality, and glamour of Catherine perfectly; and Douglas plays the vulnerable, yet tough cop perfectly, as well. I can't see another actor in any of these roles, which is one of the highest compliments I think an actor can recieve. While it looks like Douglas made the smart decision by not returning for the sequel, I look forward to seeing Stone playing Catherine Tramell again in the movie. So, film buffs who actually know what a Best Boy Grip is probably won't like this movie; but entertainment seekers will surely like it.
And hell, if you don't even care if it's a good movie...The sex scenes are great.

842,"	Eppur si muove!
 	This is the masterpiece of atheist Spanish film director Luï¿½s Buï¿½uel. An unrelentless, devastating, unmerciful criticism of religion. Yes, it can be viewed as a social satire, a political vehicle, etc. That's what makes it a great film, that you can view it from different perspectives.

To me the most valuable aspect of this film is the opportunity to see, as in a wide canvass, the soul and mind of this great atheist man. It is revealing that Buï¿½uel took to the task of ""proving"" religion wrong and absurd with so intense passion and -I would even say- desperation. Because no one is more desperate than he who searches and can't find. But, as Unamuno would say to explain the angst of the author, it comes from seeking to believe with the reason and not with the life.

The film depicts Spain's social condition pretty accurately in those mid-century years. Unamuno explains this aspect (though he wrote decades before Buï¿½uel's work) as follows: ""In France and Spain there are multitudes who have proceeded from rejecting Popery to absolute atheism, because 'the fact is, that false and absurd doctrines, when exposed, have a natural tendency to beget scepticism in those who received them without reflection. None are so likely to believe too little as those who have begun by believing too much.'""

Another important aspect of the film is the way he depicts the poor. Helplessly incorrigible, lacking as much in money as in human virtues, and extremely ugly and repealing. It is very curious how Buï¿½uel did not even allow any little space for sentimentality or candidness; I mean, there is no hero or anything even close to it. It's a terrible portrait of the human soul. I would say pessimistic, but I don't think Buï¿½uel would agree. He would probably prefer sincere or realistic. The symbolism is so evident that any private school kid could figure it out, so forcibly paired are the scenes with their objects of criticism. And trying to make it so evident (and not as difficult as other of his surrealistic films) evidences his intensity of feeling, his anger, his hatred of all that Buï¿½uel despises, religion. And not only Catholicism -it just happened to be Spain- but universal religion. Going back to the the poor in the film, Buï¿½uel being a communist sympathizer, it is ironic that he doesn't show even a little mercy with his poor. I think the rich young man is a more admirable figure than any of his other characters. The female protagonist, the nun who gives up her vows being used only as a tool, cannot be expected to represent all nuns or all religious persons -it would be preposterous-. A case that in real life might happen isolatedly should not be used to prove a general rule. It is dishonest. But there is a correlation between his view of the economically poor and the Christian view:

""For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always."" John 12:8

Isn't there something of the same nature? So how can one conception of the poor lead Christians to love them nevertheless (knowing that they will always be around), and the furious atheist/socialist to despise them (maybe not to condemn them, because surely ""society or the rich"" would take the blame). Well, that question is for everybody to meditate on.

I wish people like Buï¿½uel would give Christ a chance. Unamuno, another great Spaniard, says: ""Note the greater part of our atheists and you will see that they are atheists from a kind of rage, rage at not being able to believe that there is a God. They are the personal enemies of God."" But -I say- how can you be an enemy of someone who does not exist? 

However, this is a great and splendid work of art. But now, ending with a quote from Rousseau: ""Where is the philosopher who would not willingly deceive mankind for his own glory? With believers he is an atheist; with atheists he would be a believer. The essential thing is to think differently from others.""

Nevertheless, it moves!

The film describes the social situation of Spain in those years in the middle of the century quite precisely. Unamuno explains this aspect (although he wrote decades before Buuel) as follows: ""In France and Spain there are a lot of people who have gone from rejection of the papacy to absolute atheism, because"" it is a fact that false and absurd doctrines, when they are exposed, have a natural tendency to generate skepticism among those who have received them without reflection. None of them believes as little as those who have started to believe too much. "" Another important aspect of the film is the way it portrays the poor.

 	You can't really call yourself a Pauly Shore fan unless you love Son-in-Law. And it's hard not to love this movie. Granted, it is prone to a bit of cheesiness, but this is what we both love and respect about Pauly Shore. Becca is a fresh from the farm in South Dakota, now in California at college and on her own for the first time. She misses her family and her jock boyfriend back home and feels like she doesn't fit in. But Crawl (Pauly Shore, in perfect Pauly form) her resident advisor urges her to give college life one more chance before she goes home and shows her just how much fun being on your own in a new place can be. When the holidays roll around, Crawl has nowhere to go and decides that frozen turkey dinners are just fine for Thanksgiving, but Becca insists he join her and her family in South Dakota. Crawl is the opposite of anything her family has ever seen and as if that's not enough to make things silly, Becca's boyfriend tries to propose to her, but Becca doesn't want to get married yet and Crawl announces to the family that he's already proposed to Becca. Now absolute silliness takes over and it's just so much fun from here on out. If you need something fun and funny to watch, give Son-in-Law a try. One of my all-time favorites in my collection of silly comedies. You'll love it

Ms. Argento pulls no punches--she splatters herself all over each frame, even introducing the film in a video prelude. She should be recognized as a hero, instead a lot of critics and viewers may think she is just being a self-pitying exhibitionist. But I bet if a man made this film, these selfsame critics would line up to praise it. Obviously many self-proclaimed feminists (of both sexes) are still secretly terrified, turned-off and intimidated when a women dares to actually show her ""real"" self. They are all the more angry because their knee-jerk reactions remind them they are not as ready to hear the truly ""liberated"" female voice as they might like to think.

849,"	Next time take the bus...
 	I rented Terror Train (1980) with a friend of mine about ten years ago and I remember after we watched it we were both like ""Is that it?""  Not recalling what our criticisms of the film were at the time, but I decided to give it another chance, and you know what?  I liked it...I really did...I'll grant you it's not an outstanding feature, but the effort is there, resulting in an overall solid film.  Directed by Roger Spottiswoode (The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper, Turner  and  Hooch, Tomorrow Never Dies), the movie stars Jamie Lee Curtis (The Fog, Trading Places, A Fish Called Wanda), who, a couple years earlier, had appeared in a little horror feature you may have heard of called Halloween (1978).  Also appearing is Ben Johnson (Hang 'Em High, Red Dawn), Hart Bochner (Breaking Away, Supergirl, Die Hard), Derek McKinnon (Breaking All the Rules), Sandee Currie (Terminal Choice), Timothy Webber (The Hotel New Hampshire), and David Copperfield, who was at one time engaged to supermodel Claudia Schiffer but called it off as their relationship interfered with his work, earning himself a place in the `What the f?' hall of fame.

As the movie opens, it's New Year's Eve, and the boys at the Sigma Phi Omega house are having a party.  After a prank directed at one of the spaz fraternity pledges goes horribly wrong, we fast forward three years and see another New Year's Eve bash in the offing, this time a costume affair taking place on an excursion train, hosted by Doc (Bochner) and Mo (Webber), two of the fraternity brothers responsible for the prank that occurred three years ago.  Also in attendance is Alana (Curtis), Mo's girlfriend, who was also involved in the prank, but not to the extent to being fully aware of what exactly Doc and Mo had planned, resulting in some bad blood between her and Doc, who was essentially the ringleader (and a real a-hole, to boot).  Anyway, turns out the nerdlinger who was the victim of the gag is now a dangerous, homicidal psychopath, has decided this a good opportunity to exact his revenge by sneaking on board the train and murdering all those who wrong him back in the day.  Actually, it was a pretty good move because not only is most everyone disguised in costumes, but they're also stoned and/or drunk, and easy pickings.  Also, the trip is an all night deal with no place to stop, so once the fun begins, it won't end until it ends...eventually those on board learn there's a killer among them (after the corpses start piling up), but he could be disguised as anyone, so who's to be trusted?  Oh yeah, a magician played by David Copperfield is also on board for the purpose of entertaining the rubes, performing his illusions (never call them tricks as that really ticks him off).

Like I said, I liked this Canadian produced movie, at least the 2nd time around.  I'm not sure what changed, other than the fact I'm older, but I think I have a bit more appreciation for the effort put into developing the characters within the film.  I believe this helped, especially in terms of Jamie Lee Curtis' character, as we saw she had real empathy for the kid who got tricked not so long ago (apparently she tried to visit him after he ended up in the hospital), along with strong disliking for the person whom she saw responsible for the prank, that being Doc, a self centered, manipulative type, mostly for his cruelty, but also because of the way he used her in his scheme.  The result of all this was an effort to make us feel for Curtis' character in that maybe she didn't deserve the same fate as the rest, and it work, for me at least.  The movie does fall within the `slasher' realm, but gore hounds will most likely be disappointed as there's actually very little bloodletting violence.  Spottiswoode, in his directorial debut, instead seems to be focusing on the suspenseful build up, rather than on the visceral material normally present within the genre.  I thought there was some very decent scares throughout the film...I didn't jump out of my seat or anything, but the movie did keep my attention.  The goofy bits for me was how well the killer was able to keep his identity hidden, even after those on the train realized who was the one responsible for the killings.  The story does throw around a red herring or two, but at one point, before his identity on the train is revealed, you should be able to discern which passenger he is...there was a definite sense of claustrophobia, as most of the film takes place on train that has only three or four cars, but then this also made the difficulty for those trying to find the killer seem all that much more, well, dumb.  One element that didn't really help was the amount of time spent watching David Copperfield perform his magic.  His character, who seemed quite smarmy to me, did figure into the plot, but it just felt like his lengthy performances were included to help pad out a decent running time.  I don't mind magic, but I would have  preferred there not to have been as much as there was since this was supposed to be a horror film.  It was kind of funny, though, given how seriously he takes his craft, to see him stuck on an excursion train having to impress a bunch of drunken college kids.  I did like the bit after the main conductor, played Ben Johnson, discovered the first body and attributes the death as being caused by `some kid messed up on dope'.  As far as Ms. Curtis, her presence here did help a lot, and probably resulted in quite a few seats being filled at the time of the movie's release given her prominence of `Scream Queen' in the late 1970s/early 1980s (she had all of three films out in 1980...this one, along with The Fog and Prom Night).  Overall I found this to be a fairly engaging film, one that rises slightly above that of your run-of-the-mill slasher feature.

The picture quality, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks decent enough, and the audio, available in both Dolby Digital mono and stereo comes across well.  There's really not much in the way of extras other than a theatrical trailer for the film and subtitles, available in both English and Spanish.

850,"	One of My Favorite Woody Allen Films
 	Up until last years Match Point, Crimes and Misdemeanors was considered 
Woody Allen's last great film. I've only seen 3 Woody Allen films (not counting Match Point) that came out after C and M and before MP, but I'd have to agree. Crimes  and  Misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with Allen's greatest work. Films like The Purple Rose of Cairo and Annie Hall.
It's a perfect blend of drama and comedy. In fact, Match Point was kind of a retread of this film. The drama without the comedy. This movie stars Martin Landau ('Ed Wood') as Judah Rosenthal, an eye-doctor (I don't remember the term for one) who's been having an affair with a woman named Dolores (Anjelica Huston, 'Buffalo 66'). Problem is, he's tried to break it off but Dolores isn't having it. She's, instead, threatened to expose his infidelity to his wife. He's barely intercepted the letters. He looks to a patient, a rabbi (Sam Waterston, 'The Killing Fields'), for help...But it's not working. When he turns to his mobster brother Jack (Jerry Orbach, 'Law  and  Order') for help. Jack suggests murder. Judah reluctantly gives in. Meanwhile, a filmmaker named Cliff Stern (Allen) is tapped by his brother-in-law Lester (Alan Alda,'Mahattan Murder Mystery') to make a documentary special on him. Cliff hates Lester, but isn't getting work anywhere else. While working on it, Cliff meets Halley Reed (Mia Farrow, 'Rosemary's Baby') whom he falls for, despite being married. In typical Woody Allen style, the film is fueled mostly by conversations between the main characters. I liked his ploy of showing clips of old movies (as a character was watching them) that kind of went over what was occurring in his own movie. The movie is separated into comedy and drama, kind of like Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda."" The drama part is the Judah plot. The comedy is the Cliff plot. Although both of them drift into the other category occasionally. They both finally come together at the end. The movie simultaneously reminded me of Match Point and Manhattan. The former for obvious reasons, the latter because the endings are similar in what happens to Allen's character. Anyway, the acting is great of course. As is the dialogue, as always. There's a lot of great one-liners (""I haven't been inside a woman since I visited the statue of Liberty"") and some physical bits of humor as well. If you're a fan of Woody Allen, you'll definitely love it.

 	I've also reviewed the first two volumes but I honestly believe that Volume Three is the best.  I plan on getting them all and have the entire series for the first time in my life but, if I had to pick a single best volume, it would be this one.

FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE has the most solid Cold War story of all the films and everyone is firing on all pistons.  Connery IS Bond in this one, making the character his own, and Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya as the villians are among the best.
ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is George Lazenby's only film and it remains a controversial entry in the series.  Myself, I loved it.  Diana Rigg is awesome, the photography and editing are great, and the story feels like it has more meat on its bones than any other film.
(These first two films probably come closest to the Ian Fleming novels).

LIVE AND LET DIE is Moore's first appearance as Bond.  It has a hit Paul McCartney  and  Wings song and a 19-year-old Jane Seymour, along with a very charismatic villian in Yaphet Kotto.  The boat chase is still thrilling and Sheriff J.W. Pepper is still hilarious.
GOLDENEYE is Brosnan's first appearance as Bond and remains his best film.  Wonderful use of Russian locales, particularly the ""graveyard"" of Communist statues, and the deadliest Bond girl since Pussy Galore.

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY was an attempt to get back to better stories after the overblown epics of the Seventies.

So, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a bad one in the lot.  Like I said, I plan on getting them all--but this one looks like the best.

With a left hell he now has only himself and a little dog companion (Beefy). Nicky has to learn to live a human life and keep his two twisted brothers trapped in a mystical vial.The two of them and the fact that he can't ""let go"" of evil leaves Nicky confused and dazed. The movie had some really cool supporting characters like two rocker / satin enthusiasts. The music is impressive with some good old AC / DC songs and the comedy is actually witty. Many say the jokes in this movie are a bit lame, I couldn't find any reason to criticize this movie otherwise. A must"
859,"	A Rodger Dodger In An Age Of Politically Correct Repression
 	This is a fun  and quot;art house and quot; movie. Fun because the script is tight and the acting top notch and you know from the start you are in the hands of a good director. Just the kind of thing you want from a night at an art house: not a message movie like many such films but instead in-your-face film making - and three cheers for that. Campbell Scott plays the smooth player who tutors his nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) on how to get laid. The action takes place mostly in one night of bar and party hopping. This script is so good that any bar lizard could learn from the lines and strategy used by Scott's character. Scott's character is an accomplished and dedicated player who never sees the wrong in his ways and that is the delicious and honest part of the film. One review talked about the player venting his anger at women but my take was that he stayed in control the entire movie, venting naturally (and within limits) when he was thrown over by his boss/lover. Like him or hate him, the player is a pro from beginning to end. The viewer has to decide whether he likes or dislikes women. In the final analysis what matters is how well Campbell Scott's character plays the game and he is a rodger dodger in an age of Politically Correct repression. How refreshing! Five stars out of five

 	THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is the epitome of how sublime the Film Noir genre can be.  The story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome hired-hand into murdering her much older husband.  Based on the novel by James M. Cain and boasting the stylish performances of Lana Turner and John Garfield, this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic.  Over half a century later, we are still singing it's praises.

From Lana Turner's memorable entrance as Cora Smith (clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres), the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills.  The drifter Frank Chambers (Garfield) is so completely infatuated that murder can be as easy as picking up a lipstick case.  Cecil Kellaway, Karl Malden and Hume Cronyn co-star.

 	You can't wipe murder off our hands; well perhaps you can, especially if you're like the two main protagonists in The Postman Always Rings Twice, an absolutely marvelous movie of dark despair and foggy, murky paranoia. Based on the novel by James M. Cain, the movie is all about the terrible consequences that can result from unchecked desire and obsession.

The sexy John Garfield stars as Frank Chambers, a tough, enigmatic drifter from San Francisco who arrives in the small California town of Twin Oaks. Frank's a pretty rough and tumble sort of guy; he's a little lazy and a bit of a con artist, but he's decent enough and soon he gets offered a job in a diner run by Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway). 

Nick is very eager to employ Frank, but Frank initially hesitates, that is, until he meets Nick's much younger wife, Cora Smith (a gorgeous Lana Turner). Cora is a blonde bombshell, a real knockout, first appearing in front of Frank in skimpy shorts, she's even photographed from the legs up. Cora is a teasingly sexy femme fatale, rolling her lipstick towards him in a hesitant dance of seduction, perhaps a promise of what is to come. 

The sexual attraction is almost immediate, and as the tension steadily builds, they begin a clandestine affair, taking moonlit swims together, while the affable Nick remains totally unsuspecting of what's going on. Soon Cora confesses to Frank that she doesn't love her husband and she that married Nick to give her a sense of security. Desperately in love, the two decide to run away together by hitching, but Cora decides she doesn't want to start life again with nothing and returns to the diner. 

By this time, Frank can't get Cora out of his head, and with both of them feeling ever more trapped, they decide to arrange an accident for her unsuspecting husband. But their plan doesn't quite work; the situation becomes even worse when the local DA (Leon Ames) catches onto them and their evil schemes. The plot takes many twists and turns as Cora and Frank try to outmaneuver the law, Nick, and also a pair of unscrupulous lawyers who are intent to see the sultry couple double-cross and sell out on each other. 

Despite the imposition of strict censorship laws, The Postman Always Rings Twice bubbles over with passion, even though much of the sensuality is suggested. And because the censors wouldn't allow any sex or violence, the filmmakers had to imply what was going on, so the film projects an undercurrent of barely disguised passions, sexuality, and murder. 

The censorship restrictions also make the performances of Garfield and Turner that much stronger. Relying on sharp dialogue and facial expressions, the actors manage to weave a gorgeous sensual dance together, both lighting up the screen and creating two of the most smolderingly complex characters ever seen in film. 

The Postman Always Rings Twice is a classical noir tale of love that just goes disastrously wrong. Lust, deceit, lies, and betrayal inevitably result because the two star-crossed lovers just can't let go of each other and are trapped by their desires. Cora is dreadfully insecure and wants something in life that has always eluded her. And Frank is too caught up in his feelings for Cora to see reason; he's just too weak-minded to see how warped his judgment has become. 

The Postman Always Rings Twice was remade in 1981 with Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson in the lead roles. I've never seen it, but hearsay suggests that, although it is much steamier (minus the restrictive censorship laws), this version is still far superior, even after all these years. With its edgy character development, it's stylish photography, and with Turner and Garfield as the leads, it is indeed a terrific film and remains a verifiable masterpiece of Hollywood film noir.

865,"	Fantabulous movie...required viewing for rock fans everywhere!
 	I was reluctant to watch ""Almost Famous"" because I figured it would be chock full of hype...but for some reason I decided to finally sit down and watch this story...and I'm glad I did.  I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies. Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.

I especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old-timer band-aides while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully...

""They don't even know what it is to be a fan. You know, to truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts...""  

Although I am not, and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination I am an avid rock/pop music aficionado, I thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of die-hard fandom perfectly... 

I liked the way Cameron Crowe humanized the groupies...sure some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional, but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars...and they do have feelings, just like anyone else...and I thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of ""Penny Lane.""  I can remember when back in the 70s, groupies were ""little celebrities"" themselves...so sersonally, I don't think that people should label them as tramps or judge them too harshly...besides, who knows...maybe someone you know or may be related to may have a ""sweet little secret"" they've been keeping along these years? It was the 70s after all...some of those rockers got around...and some apparently ordinary girls did too...fact: some of those gals just did what many of us wished we could do...and they were for the most part honest about it...

At any rate, the music used in the movie is just awesome! It sure was fun to hear ""Go All The Way"" by the Raspberries as well as ""Tiny Dancer"" by Elton John. How could you not sing along to that 70s classic?

Now that I've been reading the reviews about the ""bootleg"" director's cut, I'm going to have to watch that one, too.

 	BEST MEN surprised me very much; I wasn't expecting such a delightful, if a little bit depressing, movie.  Directed by Tamra Davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor, this movie is one of those you smile most of the time, and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot.
Luke Wilson plays Jesse, a convict getting out of prison after a theft, and who is getting married to his sweetheart, Hope (Drew Barrymore).  Along for the ride are his best friends (Dean Cain as a former Green Beret, who is gay; Mitchell Whitfield as the lawyer Saul, who was Wilson's lawyer; Andy Dick as the nerdy Teddy, who is in a bad marriage; and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays Billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as Hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks.  Billy doesn't tell his buddies that he's planning on robbing a bank before the wedding, but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff (Fred Ward) who also happens to be Billy's father!  Soon, the inevitably nasty FBI comes in, headed by the sadistic and cold agent, played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable Raymond J. Barry (Dead Man Walking, The Chamber).
The movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale.  This dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest.  Brad Dourif gives one of his best performances since ""Cuckoo's Nest"" as the mentally challenged Vietnam vet.  Fred Ward, Dean Cain, Sean Patrick Flannery and Mitchell Whitfield are also excellent.  It's the best work I've seen Cain do.
The movie entertained me immensely, and I would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy!  Or is it a comic drama?

 	`Ben-Hur' released in '59 is an inspirational tale of betrayal and revenge, love and endurance, forgiveness and redemption played out amidst the backdrop of the last years of Jesus Christ's earthly ministry.

Plot: Judah Ben-Hur (Charleton Heston), a wealthy Jew living in the Holy Land is falsely accused of crimes against Rome and sent off to spend the rest of his days as a slave on a Roman galley. His estate is confiscated, his Mother and sister thrown into prison. His accuser is a Roman officer named Messala (Stephen Boyd), Judah's best friend since childhood. 

Judah survives the hardships of slavery, gains his freedom and eventually becomes the adopted son of a powerful and wealthy Roman Reagent. Providence certainly appears to be guiding Judah's path. However Judah's heart is filled with hate for Messala. He cannot forgive or forget what he and Rome has done to him and his family. He returns home in an attempt to restore what he has unjustly lost and avenge himself against his old friend.

Winner of 11 Academy Awards 'Ben-Hur' is truly an epic among epics. The massive backgrounds and sets will take your breath away, but the true beauty and strength of this film is found in the story it tells and the incredible cast that brings this story to life. The most memorable scenes in `Ben-Hur' are the intimate moments, the quiet conversations, the longing glances. My personal favorite moment is when Judah finds himself falling hopelessly in love with Esther (Haya Haraeet) one of his house slaves. While granting her freedom so she may be free to leave his service and marry, he places her slave ring on his own finger as a symbol of his undying love for her.

 	When I am watching a 1984 sci-fi movie, I am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns.  Some may call it predictible, but myself I feel that the story flowed and made sense.  Too many times have I seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere.  Tom Sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop.  Gene Simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his KISS type persona and plays the evil genius well. I for one enjoyed this movie alot, and unlike Blade Runner didn't find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line. If you are looking for a believeable near future story, pick this up
",1,"Gene Simmons plays a fantastic villain! When I see a sci-fi film from 1984, I don't expect to see an Oscar-winning portrait full of twists and turns. Some might call it predictable, but I myself feel that the story flowed and made sense. Too often I have seen a film whose course is certainly unpredictable, because the climax of the action comes out of nowhere. Tom Sellek plays the role well and is very credible as a hardened and sometimes cynical cop. Gene Simmons in one of his only notable film appearances adopts his KISS-type persona and plays the evil genius well. I for one really enjoyed this film and, unlike Blade Runner, I didn't watch it five times to understand the very shallow plot. If you are looking for a credible story in the near future, take this"
875,"	Unto  the Next Generation
 	HOUSE OF STRANGERS is a cautionary film about the dangers of hatred being passed onto the next generation almost as if hatred were an old and unwelcome pair of shoes. Edward G.Robinson is Gino Moretti, a self-made banking magnate who built his fortune as a ruthless moneylender who chose not to observe the usual niceities about observing normal banking regulations concerning records and collateral. In his over the top performance as an Italian who might have been Vito Coreleone had the Don chosen to go straight, Robinson is a totally self-centered egomaniac who comes off more as a smug Biblical patriarch holding court over his captive family than he does the old-world banker who believes that his money gives him rights that transcend filial obligations. It is hard to like him as he rips into his four sons, insulting each of them in ways that undercut whatever sense of independence and goodness that otherwise might have been there. It is only Max (Richard Conte), who can see,if only belatedly, the vision of his father. And even Max learns that he must purge himself of the bitter dregs of poison and animosity that afflict his brothers. Max cannot do this alone; he requires the understanding first of Maria (Debra Paget) then later Helen (Susan Hayward), both of whom act as leavening agents that continually remind him of the goodness that each is sure lies within. Gino Moretti is truly a vicious inverted father figure in whose futile bleatings to his ungrateful sons,""Who do you think I built this bank for?"" generates no pity in them but rather a sense of loss in us that he probably heard the same empty words from his father. The difference between the utter tragedy that this film was just a hairsbreath away from and the modest sense of optimism that it does end with is probably no more than what may, in similar real-life situations, have emerged. What goes around truly comes around, and HOUSE OF STRANGERS continually reminds us of the truism of that cliche

It is hard to like him while he is tearing himself apart in his four sons, insulting each of them in a way that undermines any sense of independence and goodness that would otherwise have been there.

876,"	Contents of the set
 	Before anything else, I agree with those who say that Keaton's shorts are all good; but I strongly disagree with those who say that they are better than his better features. What usually happens with comedy is that people sit down before the screen and just say: OK, make me laugh. Keaton's features are funny -but they are also, and more important, beautifully shot, superbly acted and perfectly structured -which is something only the best actors/directors can put all together. There are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20's. Keaton's characters move in the real world, with real things, and that's part of what makes them lasting and unique. 

In your shelves, Keaton shouldn't share his place with the Marx Brothers, but with Orson Welles (who called The General the best movie ever made about the Civil War) and Martin Scorsese (who said he watched over and over the final fight in Battling Butter -which, by the way, is not supposed to make you laugh, but to surprise you with it's realism)

Now, this are the complete contents of this DVD set. Aside from it, you should check out The Buster Keaton Collection, which includes THE CAMERAMAN, SPITE MARRIAGE and FREE AND EASY - and then you are done. Well, you could also read the only book he wrote -My Wonderful World of Slapstick. (June '06 Update: ""Industrial Strength Keaton""(DVD) just came out. The set includes rare industrial films, promotional films, commercials, TV appearances and outtakes.)

There are moments nearly every year that I take home with me, but Storm was filled with the most amazing skiing, some of the most unique locations, and might add the most exhilarating editing I've seen in quite a while!

 	This recommendation is for the uncut version of Leon - The Professional.  A well crafted, tightly edited, excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll.

880,"	This  story could have propelled a public outrage but stayed true to itself.
 	Luc Besson's ""The Professional""  raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman.

In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are good and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fat man's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.

Leon however does not work only on this primary level; it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.

Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it; the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerizing fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: its art, subtle and beautiful.

Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.

883,"	Looks better than we have a right to believe
 	Royal Wedding has been a favorite in the Fred Astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago.  Astaire and Jane Powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film, and Astaire's dance on the ceiling (""You're All the World to Me"") is classic.  The score, by Burton Lane (of Finian's Rainbow fame) and Alan Jay Lerner (future lyricist of My Fair Lady) is unbeatable.  I need not comment further on the film's merits--it speaks for itself.

The film is now in the public domain and, unfortunately, nearly all VHS and DVD releases of such films are deplorable at best.  That is not so in this case.  The DVD I'm commenting on here is from Goodtimes DVD (edition 05-81171), and I must say that the transfer looks pretty darn good for a PD film.  The picture is clear, for the most part, and although there are some minor color shifts and age-related artifacts present, they do not distract.  Colors are fairly bold and are well defined.  The soundtrack is pretty clear and sounds fine.  There are no extras.  I have a very old 1980s copy of the VHS tape from MGM/UA Home Video and also a VHS dub I did off Turner Classic Movies two years ago, and honestly, this DVD looks better than both.  It is about as good as we can expect for a PD film that has not been restored from original elements.  Goodtimes is often better than most in their releases of PD films--it could be a lot worse.  Warner Home Video, which controls video/DVD release rights to the rest of the old MGM library, has not given us a studio DVD release of ROYAL WEDDING as yet, and as far as I know none is in the works.

If you want ROYAL WEDDING on DVD, I absolutely recommend this Goodtimes DVD release--it is probably the best one you'll find, is at a very good price, and comes in very nice packaging.

Vincent Price plays in a scene or two, and he's revealed to be the mastermind behind the Resurrection Room at the Dante Lab {he plays a guy named Loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead}. the movie is gory and off-beat, and it succeeds in being a good parody of the Lethal Weapon 'buddy cop' films even though it probably wasn't intended to be the first time around but that's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great. i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films...but those who like that kind of film will LOVE this one. it's not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can't be seen several times...like many of the Texas Chainsaw films are...but  and quot;Dead Heat and quot; IS gory compared to other action films of this era starring Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. i give it 4 stars for the story, cast, and acting...minus 1 star for the gore factor

 	I thought this DVD set was halarious!  I was hoping it wouldn't be the case where I saw it before, and remembered it to be funnier than it really was.  But that was not the case.  It truely was one of the funniest seasons of a comedy show I've ever seen!

I wonder if the cast has some sort of deal with Sprite, though, because you see so many current and former cast members from this show, in those commercials for Sprite.

Anyone care to comment on this?

My favorite skits are probably the Movie satires, and the one with Michael Jackson doing an infomercial is halarious!  I also like the Rap Video, with Ice Cube in prison, doing a song about acting, etc.  Just phenomenally halarious!

It was so fun to see the entire Osmond Clan decked out in their holiday finest having such a wholesome and lighthearted good time. I especially enjoyed seeing Debbie, Donny's wife sing a duet with Donny. And the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well. There was even a guest appearance by the Osmond grandparents. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned Christmas special. There is a mixture of traditional Christmas songs, some uptempo numbers, and even some spiritual songs included. A particularly poignant segment included little brother Jimmy singing a song out in the snow. I'd never seen the two lesser-known older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show. One of the best Christmas specials I've seen in a long time. It made me wish that I was part of their family. After watching this I'm more convinced than ever that I am the fat Osmond who Mother Osmond abandoned in the hospital only to be adopted by some nice folks here in the Pacific Northwest

 	My daughter is 17 months old, and next to Rock and Roll, this is probably her least favorite of the Sesame Street movies (and we have a lot of them).  If your child is like mine and likes the characters she sees a lot of on Sesame Street (Elmo, Ernie, Cookie, Grover, etc.), they might not be as interested in this one (although Elmo is the cohost of the awards show with Herry).  It is nice to see the monsters that don't get a lot of play, though.  Herry Monster is in about half of the songs.  It is worth it if you don't have any videos with Monster in the Mirror (also on Rock and Roll), Fuzzy and Blue (on Sesame Street 25th Anniversary), or C is for Cookie (on several of the DVDs).

900,"	A great reproduction of a great movie with a great set of Extras
 	I need to preface this review with the comment that I am not a John Wayne fan. However ""The Searchers"" is often said to be the Duke's best movie. And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and, if anything, his real talents were underused in his career. Still ""The Searchers"" is a classic and deserves to be better known.

The 50th anniversary edition is a must for any collector. The restored print for the DVD is excellent. Just what you want to watch John Ford's gorgeous Monument Valley location shots.

The ""extras"" disk is also excellent. There are three good documentaries all of which were made with thought and genuine concern. A change from all those ""afterthought"" DVD extras. One documentary features interviews with Martin Scorsese and another some great shots of the film production camp in Monument Valley in the early 1950s, before it was on the tourist trail.

The documentaries would be of interest to serious film students and even amateur sociologists, they illustrate the many serious social issues ""The Searchers"" deals with, and takes a serious and humane point of view on, without preaching. A lesson I suppose for today's ""socially concerned"" film makers, they really need to focus on the film making and the story first. John Ford did and the message is powerful and still relevant today

 	What's not to like about Richard Farnsworth? He was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days, an extremely likable ""old man."" Hey, few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old, since he spent his younger days as a stuntman, rather than as an actor.

So, he was a very good choice to portray a likable thief: Bill Miner, the last of the stagecoach and train robbers. ""The Gentleman Bandit,"" I believe, was his label. This is a nice low-key adventure, with almost no bad language and the British Columbia and Washington state scenery is absolutely gorgeous. It would look great on widescreen DVD. What's the holdup? (pun intended)

The only bad news of this tale is the usual filmmakers' twisted message to root for a man who simply was a crook, nothing else. The film also - especially to get the younger audience - needs more action. It will be too slow for them, but I liked it, if for no other reason that I can listen to Farnsworth's voice all night. What a ""cool"" guy he was, and it''s always a pleasure to see him on screen.

906,"	""Love Story"" told by Paul Verhoeven
 	Few days ago, I watched the documentary ""Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession"" (2004) about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100, 000 lucky subscribers in LA in 70s - 80s. While enjoying the clips from many Foreign and Independent movies that were the best part of documentary, I was able to recognize the movie that I saw many years ago in Moscow and still remember well, I could not only recall the title. I remember that the movie was Dutch, very erotic - in the raw, brutal, twisted yet beautiful and passionate way. Watching ""Z Channel..."" I was happy to instantly recognize ""Turks fruit"" (1973) aka ""Turkish Delight"" made by Paul Verhoeven in 1973. I checked with Netflix, the movie was available; I bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it. My memory served me well - Verhoeven's early film is as naturalistic, earthy, brutal, erotic, humorous, poetic, poignant, and captivating as I remember it. Based on the novel by Jan Wolker, ""Turkish Delight"" stars young, hot, very sexy (and I mean it - VERY SEXY) Rutger Hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor Eric and even younger Monique van de Van as his wife Olga, child-like yet as sensual as Eric was, ""the light of his life, the fire of his loins"". The film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful Holland's film that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film and was proclaimed by Jan Wolker a ""75% masterpiece"".

There are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as Verhoeven (of his Dutch period, especially). Verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work, fiery temperament, and aggressive movie-making. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven on two films said about him: ""The guy is like his movies: brilliant, mercurial, very daring, perverse, a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions..."" ""The Turkish Delight"" is all that and I love it but I can understand how its graphic sexuality, more than one disgusting and revolting scenes (but they had to be in the movie) and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers. Be prepared, ""Turkish Delight"" is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch.

 	Ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks. It seems to have all the usual bits: knight on a mysterious quest, lovable thief, and a loving couple under a vicious curse. Even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film, due largely to the outstanding cast: 
- Rutger Hauer (the knight, of course), 
- Michelle Pfeiffer (the other half of the cursed couple),
- Matthew Broderick (knave with a heart of gold), and 
- Leo Kern (aging hermit, in on the terrible secret). 

Saying much more would mean saying too much, but it has the fairy tale ending you'd hope for and expect - good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs.

One thing about this movie (or maybe the DVD transfer) truly annoys me, however. Someone messed with the colors, like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters, and hasn't learned how garish they can be. To whoever did it: please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time.

Outside of that, it's a safe, entertaining movie. Enjoy!

It was discussed in school yards and in the lunch room, at slumber parties and later when I started working as a clerk in a grocery store. It was a never ending argument- Who would win in the battle of Freddy and Jason? In my youth children spoke of some underground video tape that contained a battle between the two monsters, but I don't think that it ever existed and if it did I have never laid my eyes on such a relic, but finally the horror movie to end all was released onto the big screen and later on to DVD. It was everything I hoped for. There was blood, brief nudity and really bad jokes. That is the unholy trinity of horror. The plot wasn't horrible, it was actually pretty good for a fright flick.

 	John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono were guests on the Dick Cavett show three times in 1971.  Their first apearance was taped on Saturday, September 11, 1971 and was John's first interview after the Beatles had disbanded.  The subsequent interviews were taped on Friday, September 24, 1971 and Thursday, May 11, 1972.  

Viewers, Beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among Dick Cavett and his guests.  John appeared to be in his element, happily chatting with the famous talk show host.  It was a good thing John rightfully defends Yoko during this interview and makes it quite plain that she did not break up the Beatles.  She has been wrongfully blamed for something that was bound to happen naturally - after all, the individuals who made up the Beatles needed to move individually; grow; develop their own individual styles.  The group could not last forever. 

Cavett gives John and Yoko equal time.  He listens to them attentively; takes them seriously and at no time criticizes anybody or speculates about anybody.  It is very easy to forget the interviews are taking place before a studio audience as viewers are easily lulled into the flow of the conversation.

Yoko is very animated during this first interview.  She smokes; chats easily with her host about her undergraduate days at Sarah Lawrence and shows a film she made.   John and Cavett are actually funny, sharing some humorous observations about clothing and coiffure. 

Be sure to get this dvd collection.  It is funny; interesting; serious; thought provoking and memorable.  This is something for everybody and not just Beatle fans, Yokophiles and Lennonophiles.  The bonus dvd will certainly bring many smiles to many faces.
",1,"Power to the people! John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono were three guests on The Dick Cavett Show in 1971. Their first appearance was recorded on Saturday, September 11, 1971, and was John's first interview since the Beatles broke up. The following interviews were recorded on Friday, 24 September 1971 and Thursday, 11 May 1972. Viewers, Beatle fans and their colleagues will no doubt enjoy the natural flow of conversation between Dick Cavett and his guests. John seemed to be in his element as he chatted happily with the famous talk show host. It was good that John defended Yoko during this interview, and made it clear that she did not tear the Beatles apart. She was falsely accused of having to do something naturally - after all, the people who made up the Beatles had to move, grow and develop their own individual style. The group could not last forever. Cavett gives John and Yoko the same time. He listens to them carefully, takes them seriously and never criticises or speculates on anyone. It is very easy to forget that the interviews take place in front of a studio audience, as the audience is easily lulled into the flow of the conversation. Yoko is very animated during this first interview. She smokes, chats loosely with her host about her time as a student with Sarah Lawrence and shows a film she made herself. John and Cavett are actually funny, sharing some humorous observations about clothes and hairstyles. Be sure to get this DVD collection."

 	I know what you're thinking. If you're anything at all like me, when this movie was in the movie theaters and the previews were running rampantly, I thought this looked like the stupidest piece of trash to ever grace the big screen. But I'll admit readily when I'm wrong, and here I absolutely was. I'm not saying Little Nicky is the world's greatest film, or even comedy, but if you like Adam Sandler and silly comedies in general, this is a movie that won't disappoint when you desperately need something mindless to turn your brain into mush after a horrendous week (or even day) at work.

A movie that opens with Jon Lovitz acting like a big, horny bird in a tree certainly promises to be very entertaining. And it is. And we're taken straight to hell with Harvey Keitel playing the devil himself very nicely, a brief encounter with Dan Marino, and the late Rodney Dangerfield to name a few. We're also treated to the heavens above with Reese Witherspoon and the guy who played Adam Sandler's golf mentor in Happy Gilmore. This movie has everything it takes to be insanely silly and entertaining. And you'll LOVE what happens to Hitler in this. 

Don't take it too seriously. If you do, you miss the entire point of Little Nicky. If this is your kind of movie, add it to your collection...you'll watch it many, many, many times again. Enjoy

 	""Annie Hall"" is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time. The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#31), as well as The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#4). The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic-comedies ever made. It really nails that awkwardness of romance. I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don't so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but can't really get a grip on love. He's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic, which turns people off. Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton). Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it's share of ups and downs. Now, not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true-to-life but this film is also absolutely hilarious. When I see a movie on AFI's Top 100 Comedies, I tend to shy away from the films on that list. Not because they're not good, it's just that they don't really pick by what's the funniest film ever. Example, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot. But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny. The dialogue is quick-witted, some the scenes have become classics (Allen sneezing on the cocaine). In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is. This is a great film, a great romantic-comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece.

 	I wouldn't write yet another review of War and Peace if I didn't have something new to say about it, namely, War and Peace and War by Peter Turchin. Near the end of Turchin's book, about bringing the scientific method to the rise and fall of empires, he quotes extensively from the parts of Tolstoy's War and Peace. Tolstoy, with his ratio analysis of various Napoleon Grand Arme  metrics to Russian army metrics, was grappling with a theory of mathematical history well over a hundred years ahead of his time. Pick up Turchin's deep book, and afterwards read War and Peace, paying particular attention to Turchin's and Tolstoy's ideas. You will never see historical dynamics the same again.

Sincerely,

Some reviewers complained that the scripts don't stick to the originals, but this is not an issue for me here.   Christie's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they aren't always done the same way.   Any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times.  I think it's fun to be surprised by my old favorites!  Hooray for Geraldine McEwan!

 	I'm the biggest ""Wuthering Heights"" fan I know (ask anyone who knows me, and they'll tell you I borderline annoying with the subject). Having money left over from my birthday, I decided ""Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?"". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I've seen thus far haven't really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it's a good enough movie (as long as it didn't have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn't showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than '92. 

Needless to say, when I popped in the DVD, I was hooked by the first five minutes. Sure, the movie isn't EXACTLY like the story (I want you to show me a movie that is. And, as I said, this story is complex for the movies). Some of the things that are different/changed/added/etc., are the fact that, once again (as in many of the movie adaptations) Nelly is old from the start. Also, Heathcliff and Cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place (such as when they visit the Lintons). Most ""Wuthering Heights"" fanatics know that Heathcliff and Cathy never consemate their relationship. However, there's many a kiss in the movie. 

There are some other details of the movie that are different than the story, but I, a crazy ""Wuthering Heights"" and Bronte admirer, give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan

933,"	""I've never run from anybody before.""
 	It wouldn't surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie: it's rife for debate. Gary Cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity, but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end, we know he'd never do it again. Sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because ""I have to,"" and all that; but only a fool would think that a place like Hadleyville deserves protection. Can you imagine Clint Eastwood in Cooper's shoes? At least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown.

Of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with Hadleyville and its cowardly citizens, but has everything to do with Cooper and his code of honor. Isn't this the same Gary Cooper who played Frederic Henry in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, based on Hemingway's novel, a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and ""courage under fire,"" a character who says in the novel that ""abstract words such as glory, honor [and] courage were obscene""? How could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day, never mind looking his wife in the eye again, if he'd skadaddled? This existential hero had a choice to make, a life-defining one, and for him it meant only one thing. 

It's that kind of movie - meaty and meaningful. The real-time experiment is interesting in these days of TV shows like ""24,"" and the McCarthy-era witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering, too. And let's not forget the music, either. But basically it comes down to Cooper reaching out and finding nobody there, and then doing what he has to do anyway. It's a timeless idea, and the movie is a classic

940,"	Who Says Westerns are Dead?
 	The age of the Hollywood western had its apex in the middle of the 20th century, then with the change of modern society in the 1960's, the western genre lost its allure and Hollywood abandoned westerns for other fare.  Thanks to Ted Turner and his love for American Western film making, the long lost western has been reborn in a big way.  Tom Selleck continues to impress audiences as a true western hero in the tradition of John Wayne.  Selleck is more than adequate for the part, big in body and big in acting skill.  He takes the part of Paul Cable, and turns his character into someone we can believe, like, and respect.  

Cable comes back from the Civil War months before its official end. He is tired of war and killing, and wants to return home to raise cattle in his home state of Arizona.  In trying to escape his wartime experiences, Cable runs into more trouble at home.  He finds his wife terribly embittered by his absence, and his home farm is now run by former union soldiers who are naturally hostile to a returning Confederate soldier.  Cable must not only fight to regain his farm, but he must also try to rekindle the love that has been lost in his marriage.  

The story by Elmore Leonard is a solid one and very believable.  There are no dull or boring scenes, the picture grabs you and holds you throughout.  Selleck is terrific as Paul Cable, fighting for his family, his woman, and his life.  Selleck once again establishes himself as a solid western actor in the mould of John Wayne.  He is every man's western hero. Selleck carries the picture on his broad shoulders with ease.  He is supported with a fine ensemble cast, including Suzy Amis as his embittered gritty wife, and Haley Joel Osment (of ""The Sixth Sense"" fame) in a minor role as Selleck's son.  Amis portrays a western pioneering woman in perhaps one of the most realistic role ever portrayed.  Too many times we see western wonmen portrayed as prissy and prim, dressed in their long skirts and blouses without a scuff or mark of western sand or dirt.  Amis' portrayal as Mrs. Cable breaks the mould; we see her with dirt and dust on her face, with sweat dripping in lines across her face, and with a surprising ability to hold her own with wagon reins in her hands, or for that matter, a rifle.  I personally welcome this portrayal of western women, as it is undoubtedly more realistic than the western wife sitting pretty in her muti-layered petticoats.  David and Keith Cariidine are fine antagonists in the fight for the family farm.  Harry Carey Jr. plays a small role as Selleck's father-in-law.

As a collector of fine western films, I intend to keep ""Last Stand at Saber River"", as it is an excellent western film in the tradition of the great Hollywood westerns; it's not an epic, but it is fine film-making and will please those craving for a fine western drama. I recommend it.

941,"	Great mix of satire and suspense
 	This movie I consider to be akin to 'Vertigo' by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire.
He slams the porn industry in some very funny ways. You will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes.
What I liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end. I don't want to give away too much here, but a clever use of 'Hollywood Hijinks' and the line 'Don't believe everything you see' fit with the story very well.
'Postcards from the edge' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be. In this film, DePalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be.
As in 'Dressed to Kill', DePalma relies on non-verbal acting to carry the story, and quite successfully too. The scene begins when Craig Wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he's been watching though a telescope. The scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach. I believe it's about 20 minutes. Played out well with body language and facial expressions, this scene couldn't work any other way.
Like 'Vertigo', this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat. Maybe too much detail, not sure. I found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to continue.Not many movies attempt this slower approach, or do it in a way that makes it work.
All in all, definitely a must see. Keep in mind, the action is a bit slow at times.
Melanie Griffith appears here and does a great job in her role, as do the other actors. Filming, camera angels and use of props all work well. The plot is complex. This is a must see for suspense/murder mystery fans

943,"	The Inimitable DR. NO
 	We have all heard about `Product Placement' especially in the James Bond films. Did you know it goes all the way back to DR. NO and was very prominent? In the scene where Bond kicks and tosses Quarrel and Puss Feller into a stack of corrugated cartons, notice that those cartons are labeled `Red Stripe.' That's right, `Red Stripe' Beer from Jamaica! In this case `Product Placement' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film. 

In fact DR. NO is one of the best films of the series. It is much closer to Ian Fleming's prose than most of the other films thanks to Sean Connery's performance, Richard Maibaum's scripting and Terence Young's direction. At the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here. Production designer Ken Adam's sets, attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional, adorned by Syd Cain's detailed Art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in DR. NO the benchmark. Peter Hunt's intuitive and effective quick-cut editing paced the film like no other at its time. Maurice Binder's brainchild opening `gun barrel' is an incredible piece of Title Design, which is equaled only by the `James Bond Theme', composed and re-orchestrated by Monty Norman and John Barry. Ted Moore's cinematography, especially the shot of bikini clad Ursula Andress emerging from the sea, is now a classic and also set a standard for future `Bond Girls.' 

We are introduced to the organization known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in DR. NO. What is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by Joseph Wiseman. He is unlike future main villains of the series. He isn't exactly what you may call a `social animal'. Joseph Wiseman's eerie and surreptitious portrayal made Dr. No one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series. In a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen Blofeld in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL. Rounded out by the beloved M portrayed by Bernard Lee, the lovely Miss Moneypenny played by Lois Maxwell, John Kitzmiller as Quarrel and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro, DR. NO ranks as one of the best.

 	This movie was more than I expected. I was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects, and especially, the robots. You are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end. I did not expect it to be who it was. The reason why I rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from Smith. I was not prepared for it, especially since the movie is not rated PG-13 for language. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie.

 	""Kelly's Heroes"" is an odd, yet quite enjoyable war movie. This 1970's comedic, cinematic take on WWII, mixes genres such as the suicide mission/action film, the crime/caper film and the army comedy. In other words, take a lot of ""The Dirty Dozen"", mix a bit of ""Ocean's 11"" and add in some ""M*A*S*H"" plus ""Catch-22"" and you'll have ""Kelly's Heroes"". The film features a battered U.S. Army infantry unit, which has been on the front lines since landing at Omaha Beach. All they have on there minds is a little R and R, that includes booze  and  broads. That is until Pvt. Kelly (Clint Eastwood) interrogates (with a bottle of brandy) a captured German intelligence officer, who tells him about a Nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars. Kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small French bank, that is being vigorously guarded by three Nazi 'Tiger' tanks. I know in this day and age it might sound rather odd, but this is one war movie, that is not only suspenseful, but is also a whole lot of fun! Is it an accurate portrayle of WWII? Probably not. (I doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the ""Big One"") This 1970 release pretty much through its' hilarious, sharp script  has more of a Vietnam era mentality, which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it's attitudes about war. Unlike the John Wayne style war films of the past, these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes, but they are just trying to make it through the war with their a**'s intact (and maby make a little profit on the side). The film features a large, talented cast, some of whom, were already stars and others, who later went on to become big names in both television and film. This includes Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Don Rickles, Caroll O'Connor, Gavin MacLeod, Stuart Margolin, Harry Dean Stanton and Len Lesser (Uncle Leo from TV's ""Seinfeld"").

It's Hollywood at its apogee, the quintessence of silver screen glamor.  

A few of the other numbers are fun: the first, ""Don't Monkey with Broadway"" is clever  and  pleasant; later on, Fred Astaire's lovely ""I've Got My Eyes on You"" is also winning:  a charming routine that he dances to a delightful, cheerful orchestration.  Some other numbers are worth seeing, as well, but ""Begin the Beguine"" outshines everything else in this picture.

In between the numbers, there's a lot of dreary silliness afoot.  Happily, DVD technology makes it easy to skip over the dross  and  go straight for the gold.

Eleanor Powell was a very odd actress.  She was rather pretty  and  decidedly perky (how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality); she was also quite feminine.

So after a year or two of trying to figure out how to I could see the show, I heard that they were making a DVD, and I was so excited! 

I ordered it on ebay a few months after it came out, and it was fairly priced. I watched all of it in a day, and I was ecstatic. This show is all about what it is really like being a teen. Nothing fake, but not over-dramatic. Giving life lessons on everything, like internet relationships, the effects of using ecstasy, presssure (beer), family, rumors, first dates, and all sorts of things. Season One is especially perfect for prettens and early teenagers because it is based around a group of 7th and 8th Graders.

Of course, through the Seasons, the characters face changes and more dramatic situations, but somehow, there is always a Season for teens and Preteens of every age to relate to. And that's what everybody likes about the show. 

This DVD also includes auditions for most cast members, which are fun to watch, bloopers and deleted scenes, which add more to the episode, and a karaoke of the theme song which is also very fun.

 	Ronald Reagan might have gotten the nickname of the ""Gipper"" from this 1940 bio-pic of legendary Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne, but it was veteran character actor Pat O'Brien who had the role of a lifetime in the lead. James Cagney had lobbied hard for the role, but when the actor signed a petition supporting the Republican (and anti-Catholic) government in the Spanish Civil War, Notre Dame refused to okay him for the part. This was the first of only two movies ever filmed on the campus in South Bend, and if you do know that the other one was ""Rudy"" you should at least have been able to guess it had to be that one.

""Knute Rockne All American"", which was added to the National Film Registry in 1997, is a fairly standard bio-pic, evincing the almost documentary style that was standard at the time. We see how the young Rockne (played by Johnny Sheffield, a.k.a. Boy in the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies) learned to love football, revolutionized the game with the forward pass, and coached his alma mater to glory with the Four Horsemen and George Gipp. The result is a long series of episodes from Rockne's life that have varying degrees of appeal, such as when he picks up the idea for his backfield shift from watching chorus girls dance and experiments with the idea using his wife and their dinner guests.

Lots of footage of actual Notre Dame games are worked into the film, although I have no way of knowing if any of it is of the actual games being portrayed (I would be curious to know). O'Brien's performance seems a tad wooden, but if you have ever seen actual film clips of Rockne you know he is in the ballpark. A lot of the charm of this film comes from the ethos of the original Rockne, an American legend who was probably the first famous victim of an airplane crash. The result is not great, but certainly compelling (plus we all learn the correct pronunciation of his name as being Ka-Nute).

Reagan's supporting role is deservedly memorable. That same year he would get to play third banana George Armstrong Custer to Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland in ""The Santa Fe Trail"" and would provide his best performance in ""King's Row"" before military service in World War II effectively derailed his acting momentum and ultimately set his life on a different path. 

Final Note: While there is little doubt that Rockne invented the forward pass, there is debate over one aspect of this film. In his first scene as George Gipp, Reagan is sitting around doing nothing when Rockne orders him to go in at halfback to play against the varsity and run the ball. Gipp asks ""How far?"" and proceeds to run it back all the way. After crossing the goal line he bounces the ball off the endzone, instead of laying it down for the ""touchdown."" An argument has been made that this was the first spike in the history of football. At least it is the first ""recorded"" spike. Did the current tradition of choreographed celebrations all stem from what Ronald Reagan did in this 1940 film? You decide if that is yet another part of the Reagan legacy that is being reconsidered this week

Last note: Although there is little doubt that Rockne invented the forward pass, there is discussion about one aspect of this film. In his first scene as George Gipp, Reagan sits idly as Rockne orders him to go to the middle to play against the varsity and run the ball. Gipp asks, ""How far?"""
958,"	Something to discuss over coffee...
 	If no adjective appropriately suit this vivid collection of avant-garde films from the 20s and 30s, one reviewer came close in his chosen nomenclature: this one-of-a-kind-combilation, indeed, is ""indespensable""!

For anyone interested in or in some way connected to film and film studies this box set is a true gem as well as an overwhelming visceral experience. One dare even call it ""edenic"". 

Packed with cinematic treats - ranging from early classics as Joris Ivens' ""Regen"", through film historical curiosities as Marcel Duchamps' ""Cinema Anï¿½mic"" and Richter's ""Rhytmus 21"" to absolute rarities such as Kirsanoff's ""Mï¿½nilmontant"" - this impressive collection of short experimental films guides you through all main avant-garde genres of the 1920s and 1930s. From impressionist masterpieces (""Mï¿½nilmontant"", ""La glace a trois faces"" [Epstein]), through dadaist art-films (Duchamps), French and German cinï¿½ma pur/Absolut Film (""Symphonie Diagonale"" [Eggeling], ""Rhytmus 21"" [Richter]), futuristic statements (""Ballï¿½t mecanique"" [Leger]), dazzling city symphonies (""Regen"") to such seminal early sound experiments as ""Romance Sentimentale"" (Eisenstein  and  Alexandrov) and ""Le tempestaire"" (Epstein).   

While some films may, indeed, only be labled ""curiosities"" others are sheer strokes of genius - my personal favorites being Kirsanoff's rare impressionistic gem ""Mï¿½nilmontant"" (with its impressive - in every sense of the word - use of constant P.O.V.-shots, concealing the first person) and Jean Epsteins masterpiece ""Le tempestaire"" whose use of suspense-generating musique concrï¿½te (or ""Slow-Motion Sound"", as it were) and vividly, picturesque imagery make for a unique cinematic experience. - As visceral as it is beautiful to behold.

If only for its lack of a few early classics (notably, Renï¿½ Clair's ""Entr'act"" [1924] and Luis Buï¿½uel's ""Un chien andalou"" [1929] and ""L'ï¿½ge d'or"" [1930]) this combilation of early experimental films may not be labeled ""perfect"". 

However, I am still to experience any other collection of its kind. For anyone studying film (whether by themselves or in University,) this box set may, indeed, only be ascribed the adjective ""indespensible"", as done also by a previous reviewer.

Authoritative, yet not stuffy or standoffish in any way, she presents these old trad ballads in a way that makes them seem like the most immediate and compelling of contemporary art... And, of course, the music is simply stunning -- the band plays sweet, but keeps things simple; it's warm and modern without muddling down in crossover pretensions, it's just simply lovely, lovely acoustic music.  Finally, there's the experience of seeing Rusby sing: is it possible such a perfect sound is coming out of that everyday-looking lass before you?  Guess so.

 	I have been an Adult Swim viewer since Space Ghost CTC's early days. The Venture Brothers is probably my favorite of them all (The Brak Show was a riot also). I am in my 40's and so I can relate to all the jokes on the stuff I grew up on (Marvel, DC, Johnny Quest, Scooby Doo, etc). The formula started with SGCTC taking mundane kids 60's-70's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references (many homosexual), uber violence for violence's sake, profanity (beeped out but you know what they are saying), well you get my drift (think excrement jokes). It's Ted Turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi American of good vs. bad in cartoons, and screwing it all to hell. But despite the same formula over and over (SGCTC, Harvey Birdman AAL, The Brak Show, Robot Chicken, Aqua Team Hunger Force, Sealab 2021, and probably some others I missed), I still watch and laugh, with The Venture Brothers being the best of them all. One thing that I really laugh about is that the teens and gen X'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from, they are just laughing at the situations and don't get the parody. I tried to tell a co-worker (whose 25 years old) about a Robot Chicken bit about Hogan's Heroes and he never heard of that show! I'm glad The Venture Brothers has got a strong audience, so thanks you young ignorant types for watching! I'm in baby boomer delight!

The game the employees play is over the top, but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on. If you're a rude anus of a customer, don't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks won't mess with your food - they will. It pays to be polite and tip well, especially if you are a regular.

Chi McBride's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great, and I thought Luis Guzman did a great job as Raddimus.

All in all, based on personal experience, the movie wasn't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical Golden Corral or Ryan's Steak House. Sure, the characters are over the top, but they are based on people just like some I've known.

 	Foxfire is an excellent movie that demonstrates the friendship of 5 girls who learn how to stand up for themselves in this world. The inspiration for their newfound rebellion is from the 5th girl that brings the 4 others together, Legs, played phenomenally by Angelina Jolie. I must say this: I really don't care much for Ms. Jolie, and perhaps the media is to blame by making stories like her  and  Billy Bob and their whole blood thing the top news story, more recently her husband-stealing with Brad Pitt, but I cast aside those feelings for an hour and 40 minutes and found myself absolutely loving her performance. If you are like me and don't like her, please do give her a chance in this film. She's astonishingly good and I kept having to remind myself it was Angelina. 

As a matter of fact, the entire cast turns in memorable performances. I think this is a great movie for women to watch but I don't know if men will enjoy it quite as much. I did see one male reviewer claiming he didn't find it to be just a chick flick, but he might be the minority. Guy or gal, if the story sounds intriguing to you, and it really is, then Foxfire is definitely worth checking out. I give it only 4 stars simply because the character of Maddy (wonderfully played by Hedy Burress) has a boyfriend but she nevers breaks up with him and he kind of fizzles into the background. Left me wondering why he was even in the movie to begin with, but that's my only criticism.

At this price, it's a fabulous addition to your collection, though believe it or not, the low price right here on Amazon has been beaten by Wal-Mart...it's in the $5.50 bin. This is a great movie that reminds us that sometimes people will make it difficult for you to do the right thing, but you must believe in yourself and stand for what you believe.

This is a great film that reminds us that sometimes it's hard to do the right thing, but you have to believe in yourself and stand for what you believe. Absolutely recommended"
973,"	BERGMANIA!
 	Probably the best place to start for Bergman initiates. Three decent films (although I think ""Through A Glass"" is in a different class to the other two features). Moreover, they all form a useful overview of the progression of Bergman's art from circa 1960 to circa '62; from the religious torment of 1961's ""Winter light"", through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of ""Through A Glass..."" to the explicit focus on familial relationships of ""The Silence"", (the latter reminiscent of Bergman's mid-to-late 60's output). In short, although there is nothing to match the astounding ""Persona"" (1966), the films do give a great indication as to Bergman's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in Euroean Art House cinema of the early 1960s in general. 

DVD: Excellent Criterion transfers. The documentary disc a Swedish film about the production of ""Winter Light"") is excellent as well, worth watching alone for Bergman's casual conversations on his religious torment: he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread
",1,"BERGMANIA! Probably the best starting point for Bergman insiders. Three decent films (though I think ""Through A Glass"" is a different class from the other two). They also provide a useful overview of the development of Bergman's art from around 1960 to around '62; from the religious torments of the ""Winter Light"" of 1961, to the connection between interpersonal conflicts and religious neurosis in ""Through A Glass..."" to the explicit focus on family relationships in ""The Silence"" (the latter reminds us of Bergman's work in the mid-to-late 1960s).

 	Soldier of Orange with commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven is a must-see for all history buffs, WWII historians and lovers of war movies.  Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema,  it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of  a small group of law students in Leiden, The Netherlands.  Verhoeven's commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray, while asking some very thought provoking questions.  Verhoeven and I are the same age, and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation.  His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different. I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate.  Having said all that, I still consider the DVD one of my most favorite productions, including the film itself.

977,"	The Forgotten 30's Horrors of MGM and Warners
 	This is a wonderful collection of horror pictures made by MGM and Warner Brothers during the Thirties. Neither studio was noted for horror pictures, but the ones they did make are unforgettable to fans of the genre as well as late night movie addicts. Following is a synopsis of the films contained in the collection:

THE MASK OF FU MANCHU (MGM, 1932) - Boris Karloff is wonderfully creepy as Sax Rohmer's evil genius, Dr. Fu Manchu. It would not be the last time Karloff played a Chinese, as he later starred as Mr. Wong in Monogram's low budget detective series later in the decade.  The plot concerns a race between good guy Lewis Stone and Fu Manchu to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan. If Fu Manchu gets there first he will possess the magical relics placed there which, in turn, will allow him to enslave the world. Look for a young Myrna Loy in a delightful turn as Fu's diabolical, and scantily-clad, daughter.

DOCTOR X (WB, 1932) - A good early effort by Michael Curtiz concerning the ""Moon Killer"" murders in which the victims are strangled, cannibalized and surgically dissected under the light of the full moon. Wise-cracking reporter Lee Tracy traces the clues to a spooky seaside mansion, where Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill) and his colleagues are conducting strange experiments. Made in early two-strip Technicolor, the film is wonderfully atmospheric, and the sets themselves will linger in your mind. Aside from the irritating Lee Tracy as reporter Lee Taylor, the acting is crisp and to the point. Atwill in particular is eerie. Fay Wray is good as Xavier's daughter. I won't give any more of the plot away, but just remember the phrase ""synthetic flash."" Once heard, it will linger in the mind always. 
 
MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (MGM, 1935) - Tod Browning's remake of his ""London After Midnight"" with Bela Lugosi as the vampire, Count Mora, and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Newman. In the original, both roles were played by Lon Chaney. The plot concerns the death of Sir Karell Borotyn, who appears to have been killed by vampire Count Mora. Fearing that the vampire's next victim will be Borotyn's daughter, Irena (Elizabeth Allan), vampire expert Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore) is called I to protect her and shed some light on the goings-on. Look for Carroll Borland as the Count's daughter (a role played by Edna Tichenor in the original).

MAD LOVE (MGM, 1935) - One of the great plots in horror film history, and one that has been repeated many times. Colin Clive plays the brilliant concert pianist Stephen Orlac, whose hands are crushed in a train accident. His wife, Yvonne, is a noted stage actress whose ardent admirer is Dr. Gogol (Peter Lorre). Although she rejected Gogol previously, she is forced to seek his help in restoring her husband's hands. Gogol replaces Orlac's hands with those of executed knife thrower Rollo, and the fun begins. Clive is his usual tortured, neurotic self and Lorre is brilliant as the oily monomaniacal Gogol. Pauline Keal, in her book on Citizen Kane, stated that Welles copied Lorre's look for the older Kane.

THE DEVIL DOLL (MGM, 1936) - Tod Browning's last great film is about as respected Parisian banker (Lionel Barrymore), who is framed for robbery and murder and sent to Devil's Island. Years later he escapes in the company of a scientist who has discovered a way to shrink living things to one-sixth their original size. Barrymore finds a new use for the scientist's discovery as a means of revenge on those who had framed him.

THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X (WB, 1939) - The famous Humphrey Bogart punishment picture! After years of complaining about his one-dimensional gangster roles, it was said that Jack Warner decided to teach Bogie a lesson and put him in the role of a vampiric lab assistant who needs freshly drained blood in order to stay alive. Bogart is a hoot in pasty-faced white makeup and a grey streak through his hair. Wayne Morris play the wise-cracking reporter who exposes Bogie as the killer. (Tough job considering the makeup). Look for Olin Howard (Jensen the drunk in Them! and the Blob's first victim) as the undertaker. This film has never before been released on either VHS or DVD, so it is a welcome find for horror fans and Bogart fans as well
",1,"The Forgotten Horrors of the 1930s by MGM and Warner This is a wonderful collection of horror images taken by MGM and Warner Brothers during the 1930s. Both studios were not exactly known for horror pictures, but the images they took are memorable for both fans of the genre and late-night movie addicts. The following is a summary of the films in the collection: THE MASK OF FU MANCHU (MGM, 1932) - Boris Karloff is wonderfully creepy as Sax Rohmer's evil genius Dr. Fu Manchu.

The plot revolves around a race between good man Lewis Stone and Fu Manchu to find the grave of Ghengis Khan. When Fu Mandchu first gets there, he will have the magic relics placed there, which will in turn allow him to enslave the world. Pick a young Myrna Loy in a sexy role as Fu's devilish and scantily clad daughter. DOCTOR X (WB, 1932) - A good early work by Michael Curtiz on the ""Moon Murderers,"" in which victims are strangled, cannibalized and surgically dissected in the light of the full moon. Wise reporter Lee Tracy leads the trail to a spooky seaside estate where Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill) and his colleagues conduct strange experiments. The film, shot in early Technicolor double-stripes, is wonderfully atmospheric, and the backdrops themselves will stay in your mind. Apart from the irritating Lee Tracy as reporter Lee Taylor, the acting is crisp and to the point. Above all, the will is uncanny. Fay Wray is good as Xavier's daughter. I won't reveal anything more about the plot, but I remember the phrase ""synthetic lightning."" Once heard, it will always be remembered. MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (MGM, 1935) - Tod Browning's remake of his film ""London After Midnight,"" starring Bela Lugosi as a vampire, Count Mora and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Newman."

985,"	""I'm Gonna Be Like Joan Collins And You Aint Gonna Stop me!""
 	I cannot recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie, which is my favourite from the 1980's by far. The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in ""Big Business"",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood's Golden Age. A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely doesn't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory. The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in ""Big Business"", it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York's business world.

The story begins in a flash back when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton are passing through rural backwater Jupitor Hollow when Binky goes into labour. At the same time locals Garth and Iona Ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of Sadie and Rose but are also mixed up. We move forward forty years to where Sadie Shelton is the corporate head of Moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of Holomade, the local industry in Jupitor Hollow. Getting wind of their plans the militant Jupitor Hollow resident Rose Ratliff decides to go fight these ""Pinstriped Trouser Snakes"", on their own territory and Sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring Jupitor Hollow. Through a mix up they end up staying in the Plaza Hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as ""sinks in the living room"", and ""soaps in the shapes of swans""! Complication piles on top of complication as Sadie Shelton's ex husband Michael (Barry Primus), can't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural Sadie for his hard nosed wife and Jay Marshall(Michael Gross), can't for the life of him understand why Rose (Ratliff) is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure Rose (Shelton). All comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two Sadie's are really the city Sheltons while the two Rose's are really the twins meant to be in Jupitor Hollow. The fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when Sadie (Shelton), is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to Sadie (Ratliff), to put all her watching of her idol Alexis Carrington in ""Dynasty"", to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing Jupitor Hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully. 

Classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins, on the classic 1960's comedy series ""The Patty Duke Show"". I dont think I've ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in ""Big Business"". Her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails Sadie Shelton who's all ""hostile takeovers"" to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin Sadie Ratliff who only wants to be able to say ""keep the change!"" is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter. Her classic mirror sequence with her ""twin"", is a total riot and her statement that ""this whole thing has got UFO written all over it!"",will have you breaking up with laughter. Equally Lily Tomlin as both country activist Rose Ratcliff, ""I'm gonna go kick some snooty New York Ass!"", and as Rose Shelton the awkward out of place city girl ""I hate shopping and I hate New York in June!"",is also top rate. Her rejection of Jay's engagement ring as a supposed ""bribe"" and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a ""great big belly scraping pile of cow plop!"", is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene I never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening I have of this movie. Of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at New York's Plaza Hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up. Two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk's (Joe Grifasi), continual mixing up of Sadie Shelton/Ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined, and especially Fabio Alberici's (Michele Placido), total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers, the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone! The hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women (one from the country and the other from the city), seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff. It is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first. Classics like: ""Im gonna dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease!"",""Oh my God it's so COSMOpolitan"", ""Oh sure its full of crowds, smog, sex fiends, and white slavers, it's a pistol, I've got about as much use for it (New York), as a Toad has for spit pearls!"", ""Computer chips, they've got their ways!"", and ""Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase?"", are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script. 

Total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more. It is a real pity that ""Big Business"", so far has marked the only time that Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle. This film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages. I've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as I am! So I'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you haven't already. You wont regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends, in Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in ""Big Business"". Enjoy!

The story begins in a retrospective process, when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton go through the rural hinterland of Jupitor Hollow, when Binky goes to work. At the same time, the locals Garth and Iona Ratliff are expecting offspring and both women are giving birth simultaneously and both are having twins, which are not only named Sadie and Rose but are also confused.

I don't think I've ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in ""Big Business."" Her comic timing and facial expressions are first-class, and her transition from the hard-nosed Sadie Shelton, who is all ""hostile takeovers,"" to the naÃ¯ve and utterly impressive Sadie Ratliff, who just wants to say, ""Hold the change!"""

991,"	His swan song
 	An exercise in self-aggrandizement, but done so well it's forgivable. Set in London circa 1910, Chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill. One day as he stumbles home drunk, he smells gas, and rescues a young girl (Claire Bloom) from a suicide attempt. He nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career. Between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat, Chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past, including a great sketch with Buster Keaton in which he plays the fiddle and Keaton the piano (it was both their swan songs). The movie is autobiographical and reeks of self-importance, with a number of references to Chaplin's carrer in pictures alluded to. But there's intelligence, too, and not a little sentimentality (what Chaplin picture doesn't contain this?), but Chaplin is such a demanding master that there isn't a moment of sloughing off or cheapness. Chaplin did everything, from writing the script to composing the music, and all of it is touched with genius. Made in 1952, the movie, amazingly, was not seen in Hollywood until 1972.

993,"	Pokemon the Movie 7: Visitor From The Space Fissure
 	(Just as a note, that's the Japanese title)

There's something about this movie that I've always liked. I'm not sure what it is, but being a Pokemon fan, of course I like it. The movie have always been great, and this one has something that I really like about it. 

The movie starts out in the North Pole, with a scientist named Dr. Lund, his friend Yuko, and his son, Tory. There is suddenly an explosion, and Tory is trampled by a frightened pack of Walrein. And, as they say, after that, all heck broke looks.

A meteor is the reason for the explosion, and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average Pokemon. Deoxys, a rare Pokemon from another planet (woah, more than one Poke-Planet? Niiice.) The strange creature, carrying a rock with a gem inside, is suddenly attacked by the large, dragon-esque Rayquaza, a frequenter of the Ozone Layer. So, what the heck is he here for?

Ah, So Rayquaza feels threatened by Deoxys, and so, both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle. (With some pretty cool background music, might I add.) So, professor Lund flees with his colleages, and son.

Four years later, a young Pokemon trainer named Ash Ketchum, along with some friends, enter the high tech city of La Rousse, and as fate would have it, Tory's hometown. And, well, I won't spoil it from there. The plot is good, and Deoxys' 'destructive' intentions are less cruel than one would think. Don't worry, folks, no angsty Mewtwo-copy here.

Also, Rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie. His fights against Deoxys are totally awesome. The soundtrack is also great. I really love the music played during The opening scenes of the movie, and the fights between Rayquaza and Deoxys. The animation is very spiffy, shiny bright and new :P. 

I haven't had the pleasure of watching the original Japanese version of the movie, but when I do, I'll tell you all about it, 'kay?

Well, I guess that pretty much wraps things up. Oh yes, Tory's afraid of pokemon, due to the whole 'get attacked by a herd of walrein' thing. Heh. Okay then, Sayanora, faithful readers!

INTRODUCTION:
The Dragon Ball Z series is one of the finest animes out there, as any fan of Japanese animation will tell you. The series has a ""love it or hate it"" reputation, but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons. Young people love the series for the fast-paced action and adventure, while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters, and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time. It's no wonder the series is considered Akira Toriyama's magnum opus, and by far the best of the three Dragon Ball series. When Toei animation made Dragon Ball into an anime, they didn't copy Toriyama's mangas verbatim. They added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga, often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace. Toei even created movies based on the series! There were thirteen movies, two television specials, and one OVA/OAV. While not usually canon to the storyline, they are an undeniable part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise that can't be ignored.

OVERVIEW:
This is the thirteenth of the thirteen Dragon Ball Z movies. 

THE STORY:
Majin Buu is beaten. Our heroes have won. Peace has returned.

Yeah, right. 

Just as everyone has settled down, Gohan and Videl rescue an old suicidal man, and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the Dragon Balls. What they don't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe. The Z Fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe. But are they strong enough?

REVIEW OF STORY:
This is one of my favorite Dragon Ball Z movies, due in no small part to the unique storyline, and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular. Granted, I wish Vegeta had a larger role, but no big complaints there. There is no other part of the Dragon Ball Z series that has a storyline anything like this. The interaction between Trunks and Tapion is excellent as well. And the ending? Let's just say it stands on a plane all its own. You won't want to miss it.

OFFICIAL?
This is a rare example of a Dragon Ball Z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline. Right after the defeat of Buu, this would fit into the actual series continuity. It didn't exist in the original manga so I consider it unofficial, but you be the judge.

REVIEW OF DVD:
All of FUNimation's Dragon Ball Z DVDs are pretty much the same as far as content goes. There is no bonus content, unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the DVD to be bonus material. And honestly, I could have lived without them. Some more recent DVDs have character profiles, though these are lacking and could have been written better. Why couldn't get get interviews with cast and crew, or trivia/facts, something like that? FUNimation has a lot of room to improve on the DVDs.

THE DUBBED VERSION:
Lots of people tend to bash FUNimation's dub of the Dragon Ball Z series? Why? It's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid. They can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes, such as Full Metal Alchemist, but every time they've tried dubbing Toriyama's classic, they butcher it to hell. The nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series. Stick with the uncut subbed track.

OVERALL:
Get it. Dragon Ball Z movies don't get any better than this.

EDITION NOTES:
It was released in edited and uncut versions. Do I even have to say it? Get uncut. And watch the subtitled Japanese version.

999,"	Excellent Film ( and a little history)
 	I thought this was an excellent, excellent film. I saw it for the first time last night, and I was struck by how well it was acted and filmed. (It was directed by Jean Renoir, so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation, but it was exceptionally good.) In response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors, I would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized (the prison rooms looked like slightly-dingy hotel rooms, and the treatment of the prisoners.)However, one should realize how different World War One was from World War Two or other more recent wars. WWI had a few decent reasons for being fought, but primarily it was about European countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings. As seen in this film and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", (and the poetry of e.e. cummings) many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches. They fought for the ideals of their respective countries, but separated from the propaganda, your enemy could be your neighbor. In WWII, there was an obvious evil (genocide) to fight against that needed to be defeated, but WWI had mostly stereotypes to lend menace. 
""Grand Illusion"", like ""The Rules of the Game"" reflects the decline of the great aristocratic families of Europe that was occuring during and after WWI. Ancient families that had controled dynasties for centuries were left without the power they had held. The world moved on and left them in anachronism, a reality which Von Rauffenstein and Boieldieu foresee. Much of the film is focused on the universality of the human condition. It doesn't deny the differences between people, but it shows how the connections between people can transcend some of these barriers when faced with the reality of war

	The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot.  

Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a ""s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine. 

Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent.

1006,"	More ""Lost Cause"" Mythology
	It's amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology, from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification. This is a very dull, shapeless, stilted movie. I wouldn't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds, but since it is above all a piece of propaganda, I'm compelled to condemn it as history. What it presents is the ""War between the States"" version of the Civil War, in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes,their beloved hills and dales, their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North. There are only two Black characters, both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters; otherwise, slavery is beside the point. The generalship of Lee and Jackson, of course, is idolized, while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools. The battle scenes are perfectly predictable; guys charge on foot, other guys shoot, the fields are littered with bodies. Wouldn't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting? How real is it to show only one train, and that Southern, in a war won more by transportation than by musketry? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession, if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War wasn't really about slavery, then I challenge you honor! I defy you to read just one heavy, scholarly book, Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia. It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives, over slavery, in the 1830s, twenty-five years before the election of Lincoln. The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought, and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides, Blue and Grey

The uncompromising hatred that has been expressed in these debates will surely convince you that the Civil War was more deeply rooted than you thought, and that slavery was indeed the central issue for both sides, for both sides."
1007,"	Sex in quarantine
	Maybe for some people, to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal, but in Matt Sullivan's case, it could be a total nightmare.
After his girlfriend Nicole leaves him, Matt spends about six months devouring girls, until he starts to hallucinate. Advised by his brother, Matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems, and proposes to go through lent without sex.
For Matt's friends, this odyssey is as absurd as impossible, and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last Matt's abstinence. He doesn't have it easy, as many temptations will make him suffer, and even smell the possibility of a new love.
40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character. In a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years, this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love. OH. WHAT A SHOCKING DISCOVERY!

After initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love. Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty, who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status. Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter, Joan Fontaine in Rebecca, Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, and Martha Scott in Our Town? Well, evidently Rogers had real-life moxie too. --David Horiuchi 

Product Description
Known for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940's Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty, an indomitable working-class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society, makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) or marriage to a struggling physician (James Craig). Rogers' deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails. Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda, capturing the girl's affecting isolation, awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph. Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead (all four Oscar nominees* for their fine work), Johnny Belinda (nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture) blends atmosphere, nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi

1010,"	Is ''cringe-worthy'' a word?
	I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual ""pap"" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character. 

Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.

This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch

	I was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and Ghibli Studios previous works. All the greater the disappointment then, when less than half way through, the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. What a shame. 

If you have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him.

If you are a fan of the book, steer well clear. You're likely to want to poke Miyazaki with a stick and see if his head turns into a turnip or his turnip into a head.

	Well, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.  But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter.

	So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.

I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa!
It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.  
If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.  
If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie...
There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....  
Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????  
Yeah...

1017,"	No Diamonds....Just Rough
	This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, ""I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus"" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry ""Flash"" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity

	Cheap Trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today.
They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age!  What other band sounds better 30 years later?

After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly.  Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out.  And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song.

However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song.  NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY.  It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show.  The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc.  

The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs.  That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show.

Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety.

Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD.

1021,"	Too Sympathetic Towards Da Vinci Code, One-Sided Experts, Still Debunks!
	This DVD gives documentary coverage concerning such DA VINCI CODE topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Scion, the Knights Templar, the Gnostic Gospels, Le Dossier Secrets, Da Vinci paintings, and Opus Dei.

This DVD, BEYOND THE DA VINCI CODE seems to bend over backwards, measuring every narrated word, to try to support and be sympathetic towards the Dan Brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary, they still seem to be in favor of what Dan Brown has written in the DA VINCI CODE.

Out of a half dozen expert interviewees, the most notable are two ""big"" names who are MAJOR influences on THE DA VINCI CODE book. Margaret Starbird, author of THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR; and Richard Leigh, one of three authors of HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, (which was a NY Times Bestseller in 1982), both appear throughout this program. 

These two are probably the biggest proponents of the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy today, after Dan Brown himself. So it is especially meaningful when Richard Leigh and Margaret Starbird disagree with what Dan Brown has written!

According to expert interviewee Richard Leigh, though THE DA VINCI CODE book says that the Knights Templar found documents to prove the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy, in reality, NOBODY knows what, if anything, was found by the Knights Templar in Solomon's Temple. 

Leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram, pentacles, 5-pointed stars as mainly representing the ""sacred feminine"" is NONSENSE--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often! 

Richard Leigh also explains that the original Priory of Scion was last referenced in 1619, but the modern day Priory of Scion people from the last 50 years are ""bonkers,"" trying to present a hoax of the LE DOSSIER SECRETS, to try to gain political influence for themselves. 

This LE DOSSIER SECRETS, which appears on the bogus ""FACT"" page at the beginning of THE DA VINCI CODE book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of Jesus, but has been debunked for decades in France. It does NOT belong on a page titled ""FACT"" in the DA VINCI CODE book! That is very misleading, not factual. Brown says the LE DOSSIER SECRETS were discovered, but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney!

Margaret Starbird, another major influence on the Dan Brown novel, says that even though she believes in the Jesus/Magdalene bloodline, there is NO PROOF of the bloodline lasting into the French Merovingian line of kings, circa the first millenium A.D.

The documentary, using other expert interviewees and location footage, goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the Rose Line alignments being found in significant locations throughout THE DA VINCI CODE novel; as well as showing there is no evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Scion, let alone the Grandmaster; the rose is NOT the symbol for the Priory of Scion; and Opus Dei has NO INTEREST in the ""secret"" bloodline of Jesus/Magdalene because they don't believe it even exists.

Sadly, most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show, in brief statements, before quickly moving on to the next topic; while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE book claims about the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy.

Overall I was disappointed by this HISTORY CHANNEL DVD for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain't so in the DA VINCI CODE book--though I am not surprised, the HISTORY CHANNEL usually sides against Christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows, in my opinion.

A much better DA VINCI CODE debunking DVD is BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel's lies about history and Jesus

Brown says the leaks were discovered, but ignores the fact that they are widely known as fake. Margaret Starbird, another important influence on Dan Brown's novel, says that although she believes in the bloodline of Jesus / Magdalene, there is NO PROOF the bloodline that extends to the French Merovingian royal line, around the first millennium AD. The documentary, which interviews other experts and uses location footage, debunks the ridiculous claim that the Rose Line was found in significant places in the novel THE DA VINCI CODE.

And Opus Dei has NO interest in the ""secret"" bloodline of Jesus / Magdalene because they do not believe it exists at all."
1022,"	Only mildly interesting, and no ""classic""
	I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity.

1028,"	Pretty Woman Meets Toxic Tort
	Even though I would agree that ""Erin Brockovich"" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in ""Pretty Woman.""  I am second to no one in enjoying a good ""David and Goliath"" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the ""true"" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the ""Xena"" character is the main attraction in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).

Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in ""Pretty Woman"" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.

Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired ""work clothes"" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.

Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The ""convenience"" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar ""bonus"" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a ""thanks"" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers. 

The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.

They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.

His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment?

I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.

Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.

1038,"	The Character of Martha Dunstock
	Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. 

Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.

The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.

For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.
",0,"Instead of kindly giving a general review, my review focuses on one aspect of the film, even on one character, namely Martha. Martha Dunstock is known in the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the title of the film includes the nickname ""garbage truck"" next to the character's last name (apparently with a need to work out the point). She is portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for all the attention she receives, and unknowingly gives the Slater character information that enables him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of ""suicides"" (i.e. murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by setting off on the road of traffic. But their attempt is being portrayed as a failure. At the end of the film, Martha is battered and disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, who has completed her journey of self-actualization, turns down the school graduation party and instead invites Martha to stay at school with a video and popcorn. Martha accepts with gratitude and the closing scenes show Ryder walking down the aisle as Martha orbits her like a planet around the sun. The image of Martha in a wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and the audience, means fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all afraid of. The filmmaker does not give her any means to solve her predicament. And although some of us in the audience may be fat or disabled or both, we may still be afraid of Martha and are invited to consider Ryder's journey of self-discovery as our own, even though she is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha. This is why ""Heathers"" fails as an exploration of high school's ""hell"" (a description often used by Buffy / Angel / Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience who are not as thin and do not adhere to Western standards of beauty as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchies in this film a little too superficial and leave a bitter aftertaste. Unfortunately, the way ""fat"" people are portrayed in films like this often reflects the predictable, transparent, and absurd fixations of filmmakers."
1039,"	One Starr is far, too much
	Those of you who remember Ryan Starr from American Idol know why she quickly became ""has been"" material for VH1's the Surreal Life. Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials.  The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time.  Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression   emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails.  That is all I can say, I would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again

1040,"	Disingenuous Tripe
	Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and ""sparks fly.""  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.

From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues? 

In point of fact, however, the single attempt at ""comedy"" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.  

The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the ""actresses"" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.

About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.  Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film.

1054,"	fake ""Dog Whisperer"" - studious ignorance
	Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it. 

Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants. 

Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else. 

I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain

1057,"	This review is more about the movie transfer than the movie
	This review is more about the ""SuperBit"" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself.  The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it.

However, the transfer on to this 2002 ""SuperBit"" version is very lacking in several areas.  The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer.  The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and ""Making-Of"" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality.

They have failed to do that here.  The video and audio quality are not what they could be.

First, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc.  This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data.  However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be.

""Panic Room"" is a 112 minute movie.  Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps.  However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps.

This SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn't as high quality as it could be.  The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected.  So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate.  DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps.  This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn't even used.  The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this.  This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear.  The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used.
 
If they had encoded ""Panic Room"" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated.  

Such an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space.  A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal.  The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc.

I notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006.  Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise.  It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now.

Another thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions.  The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff.

The film itself is great and I can only highly recommend it. However, the transfer to this ""SuperBit"" version of 2002 is very poor in several areas. The idea of SUPERBIT is good, but badly implemented in this transfer. The original intention was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating additional features (such as trailers, documentaries, feature reviews, and making-of snippets) to allow for space to be reserved to present the film in the highest quality. They have not succeeded here. Video and audio quality is not what it could be. First, the movie is encrypted on a DVD-9 RSDL disc. This means that the DVD is able to store 9.5 GB of data. However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, video and audio quality is not what it could be. ""Panic Room"" is a 112-minute film. Any movie that is 2 hours or less long should fit on a DVD-9 disc without any problems, with maximum encoding rate, provided that no additional features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to transfer a 2-hour (or less) movie to a DVD-9 is 9.8 Mbps. This SuperBit version, however, only achieves an average of 6.5 Mbps. This SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1."

	""The Hospital"" as well-crafted as it is is a wholly unpleasant viewing experience.  It is not so much a dark comedy but a mean-spirited one.  I was a fan of Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network"" and at least that film had a little bit of light to compensate for the darkness.  I'm led to believe that Chayefsky must have had a bad experience with the medical profession and this resulted in him skewering it as a whole.  If George C.Scott's character is supposed to be the voice of reason why is it that when he's not brooding, drinking, or contemplating suicide he's off on some rant?  Diana Rigg is completely wasted in this film.  Her whole purpose here seems to be to sport a short mini-skirt and be ravaged by Scott's character.  The film is also not helped by the lead-footed direction of Arthur Hiller.  The medical profession can be lampooned but don't look for it in this uneven tirade of a film

1065,"	There's no person like this person
	Betty Hutton has a colossal amount of energy. She seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining. She's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers. Her voice is sturdy, durable, indestructible.

But oh my God, her acting choices ... She and the Indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film (whereas Buffalo Bill, allegedly a larger-than-life character, looks like a corpse by comparison, and Howard Keel, in only his second film, must manage to act like these are human beings he's relating to). 

Take a look at Betty Hutton's reaction upon seeing Howard Keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered ""a bit much"" if seen from the back row of an amphitheater. At best, her performance is clownlike; at worst, it's apelike. Little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity. It's a magnificent effort, and a stunning testimony to her desire to please, but her comedy has no reality, no nuance, no connection to any sincere emotion. She seizes on ""hick"" and drives that into the ground, then she plays nothing but ""infatuated"" for a while before toggling to ""resentful"" and so forth ... It's a series of masks and set pieces, but it's not a character. Judy Garland was in sad shape at that point in her life, but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind Annie's rootin'-tootinest moments, and she wouldn't have neglected Annie's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes. Nobody can do vulnerability like Judy, and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character. Annie could be a wonderful character, a great self-conflicted mess of strength, longing, guts, femininity, skill, naivete and worldiness, all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead Betty Hutton makes her a pop-eyed, crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet. I am surprised that Hutton didn't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out. Maybe they just wouldn't let her. The scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh, oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide. 

I kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on, and the memory of Betty Hutton's performance is branded on my brain, but it's because this performance seems like it's following the traditions of some other culture, some other world. It's like going to a sideshow.

That said, the tunes are a non-stop parade of hits -- there probably isn't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another, in wildly different styles, with effective melodies worth remembering. The classic tunes just keep coming. The movie works as spectacle and songfest, and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness. But if you're looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations, you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes.

1069,"	Great visuals but couldn't stomach the horrible dialogue
	I am a big fan of Frank Miller's work and I loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from. When I saw this film I was blown away by the visuals. It had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything I had seen in a movie before.

Having mentioned it's good points I have to say I was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen. It seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen. For the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through. I had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet.

Each extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like I was being mugged. What works in a graphic novel doesn't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you'll see here. All the characters were severely and tragically 2-dimensional with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience. Also, many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here.

Purists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film. However, my bottom line opinion is it's a good film to watch for the visual look only, but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the 'mute' button on. This film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark

1070,"	Big name cast adds up to unfocussed dud. The worst movie of this genre.
	Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting.

The DVD's jacket has a quote from Rolling Stone...""Think 'Sex and the City' with men!""  Well, I say, ""Think again.""   As an avid watcher of ""Sex and the City"", this film has little if any comparison to SATC.  Firstly, this film is not a comedy.  There were very small instances when I kind of chuckled, but could barely muster a real laugh.  Actually, towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that I kept hitting FAST FORWARD on the remote (those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what I mean here!).  The characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person's life.  These disjointed glimpses don't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters.  Yes, they are all bored whether they are in their 30's or their 50's.  Yes, they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs.  I usually enjoy movies with this breaking-away-from-boredom type of plot for example...Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), Facing Windows (also starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and a MUCH better film), Under the Tuscan Sun, Shirley Valentine, A Month by the Lake, etc. The Last Kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do, however.

They had nothing to do here, so obviously they didn't do particularly well this time. That really is not worth your time.

1088,"	Fatally Flawed
	Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme.

It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.

The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither).

The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic.

But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its ""thriller"" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst.

This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.)

If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension.

I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way.

I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud.

1099,"	The Most Biased Movie I've Watched in  Long Long Time
	Whatever ills are in the world, it's all the fault of the corporations. That's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie. For example, instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work, they forget that these people's alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that's why they took that job in the first place!  These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and, if they chose that job freely, it must be their BEST option, no matter how crazy it seems to us. As people's skills rise, as opportunities increase over time (by having MORE corporations and not less, to create more competition for these people's labor), and as the country becomes wealthier, these people's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact, the wages of the whole country on the average.  There are no shortcuts to his.  A famous story comes from Nepal where anti-child labor laws, at the urging of the UN, turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs, as sad as it may be, were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families.  It's a slow process, but all the industrialized nations went through that process.  Government-mandated ""shortcuts"" usually produce results which are even worse.  However, the results speak for themselves: in VERY short period of time, for example, HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China, India and around the world thanks for the ""evil"" capalism   its corporations.  No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone.  Also, cost of living is very low there, so these pennies really can go a long way, don't measure it to the cost of living in the West.  What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people? I guess to let people starve to death, then the makers of this movie don't have have anyting to complain about!?  Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who's a psychopath.  A corpoartion is a legal entity yes, and may act like a separate ""being"" as far the law in concerned, but does a corporation have a nose, feet, stomach? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis? Of course, not, than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it??  Several of the main ""spokepersons"" in the movie, Chomsky, Michael Moore, Rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality.  To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie, you'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are.  Throughout the whole movie, you're basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented, despite the director's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2   1/2, it's more like 80%-20%).  Just look at Chomsky's comments about how the consumers are so stupid, they don't realize that all the things they buy they don't really need. I mean we don't need fashionable clothes (hey, let's all dress as boring as Chomsky!), DVD players, or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun.  Who is the judge of what you REALLY need?  Chomsky, of course. He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don't. You're too stupid to know what you want, according to him. He says that you should do ""more important things"", like...perhaps studying lingistics (which he teaches but which very few care about).  The movie DOES make some correct and good observations, especially regarding polution, however, I'd say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed. It's also FULL of economic fallacies. It's worth watching I guess, just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie.  Despite all the ranting in the movie, it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life.  For examples, how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds?  Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies, forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind, forbid subsidies to companies, cut the suffocating red tape and regulation (esp. in developing countries but in the West too), cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10% (and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing, give people all around the world a better life, increase competition, etc.)  If these and other governments (and not corporations') problems were eliminated, the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away.  An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile (spoken about with much admiration), people with NO understanding about economics, how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for.

A famous story comes from Nepal, where anti-child labor laws, at the UN's insistence, turned thousands of children into prostitutes overnight, because these jobs, sad as they may be, were their best means of escaping hunger and feeding their families. It is a slow process, but all developed nations have gone through it. Government-mandated ""abbreviations"" usually lead to even worse results. The results speak for themselves: in a very short time, for example, hundreds of millions of people in China, India, and around the world have been lifted out of poverty by the ""evil"" capitalism of its corporations. No other system has done this as quickly as China and India have done in the last 15 years alone. Also, the cost of living there is very low, so these pennies can go really far, if you do not measure them by the cost of living in the West. What alternative do the filmmakers offer these people? I guess if you let people starve, then the makers of this film have nothing to complain about!? Other examples of stupidity are that a company is like a person who is a psychopath. A corporation is a legal entity, yes, and it can behave as a separate ""being"" in terms of the law, but does a corporation have nose, feet, stomach?"

	I was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories.  I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film).  Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series.
Much to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs.  What's that all about?

	the movie directors in the ME, particularly Iranians, are responding to demands by the West for certain type of movies. They produce what is demanded from them; in turn, they receive awards. cultural industry empowers these demands; they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the Western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded. There is no single ME movie which depict the story of Western imperialism in the ME and then awarded for doing so. ME movies must show that ME women are in need of emancipation; ME cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized. civilization itself is presented in vertical sense; there is a civilization somewhere out there all MEasterners are expected to reach; yet, it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them. (no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country; who deprived them of education and knowledge. the West is represented by beautiful, blonde nurses, a nice American guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his ""everyday Western knowledge of medicine"" in the midst of total ignorance, and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs. such a nice way to civilize!)
the story of Afghanistan is real. however, the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it. rather, it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand; in producing a product that can sell well. 
the situation is miserable; but what caused such misery in Afghanistan? your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is Islam; it is that Islamic culture; that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes. such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors. there is no single implying in the movie, a smallest reference, that Afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the British and then the Russian and now Americans who played their Great Game on the chessboard of Eurasia. There is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them. those imperialists came in the name of civilization; French did to Algeria, the British did to India; all in the name of bringing them civilization. It was White Man's Burden to do so. Yet Makhmalbaf needs more awards. he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of Western audiences, in order to continue to be in demand. you did a nice job, applauses; go on.

	In the film commentary, Director Robert Altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying, 'I don't know what it was about but I really liked it.' (That's a paraphrase). And I think that's the key to why this film is so bad: The director didn't know what it was about.  

The weird, atonal score by Gerald Busby was an annoyance throughout, often drowning out the dialog. It's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear, or in a psychological thriller, just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho. Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination. Just the same creepy atonal 'psycho' music all the time. 

Duvall and Spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal. Lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time, and dream-like sequences, conveying... mystery? suspense? drama what? Ah..I got it, they convey CONFUSION! That's it! The writer/director was confused!

	I have only one question about this movie. And that is, Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book? 

If you haven't read the book than you don't know what I'm talking about. But if you have, then you do.

I can't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would've been if it had been adapted correctly. Half the time while watching this, I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something, the colors were so bright.

If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes, locations, characters, and details from the story,then EVERYONE would love it. Not just 5 year olds. 

It makes me so angry when I watch this movie. Yes, its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing. Everytime I loan someone the book, I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all. In fact, it is a hundred times better. More even. 

I am really disappointed. I just don't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made. If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie, than I suggest they do it right. And if they do, then I'll be very thankful.

I just don't get it. The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better. You wouldn't believe how much better it is. 

I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book. Next time, please, please, do it right

But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.

Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.  

Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.

Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of ""ladies first.""  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.

Our ""hosts"", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.

1120,"	Don't Say a Word  (2001)
	Director:  Gary Fleder
Cast:  Michael Douglas, Sean Bean, Brittany Murphy, Skye McCole Bartusiask, Guy Torry, Jennifer Esposito, Shawn Doyle, Victor Argo, Conrad Goode, Paul Schulze, Lance Reddick, Famke Janssen.
Running Time:  113 minutes
Rated R for violence, including some gruesome images, and language.

Every fall, Hollywood trots out their latest thrillers, attempting to cash in on the college crowd who wants to bring their dates to a dark theater and take advantage of the squeamishness of the content on the screen; there is a hidden connection in the biting of nails and the changing of the leaves, yet without fail every year there are enough thrillers to keep manicurists in business. Nothing sums up the quintessential fall thriller quite like ""Don't Say A Word"", a suspense romp as routine as they come.  Diverting enough to fool you into a good time, ""Don't Say A Word"" makes one wish for a leap in time to the holiday Oscar contenders already.  Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) is a successful psychiatrist with a beautiful wife (Famke Janssen) and a cherubic daughter. On Thanksgiving morning, a group of bad guys, lead by Patrick Koster (Sean Bean), break into Nathan's apartment and kidnap his daughter. What the men want is a jewel they lost 10 years earlier in a botched robbery that is being held in a secret place by Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), a mentally unstable young girl rotting away in a hospital. Since Nathan seems to be the only medical professional she trusts, Patrick uses him as a pawn to recover the jewel. Nathan is soon at the mercy of the kidnappers, but as he gets deeper into Elisabeth's mind, he realizes the young girl could be helped after all.

It's perfect casting to place Michael Douglas in the lead role, as no one could play yuppie paranoia quite like he can. Douglas has perfected this type of performance into an art form with his work in ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""A Perfect Murder; Douglas is a little more subdued than normal in this film, as his aging seems to be wearing away his ability to play the hot, rich stud who gets in over his head. The film does contain many moments of pure distressed Douglas (his forte), with his hair glistening, teeth clenched and his eyes scanning the room, etc. Douglas, at least in the first act of the film, makes an attempt to carry the picture with his expected bag of tricks. Soon enough, director Gary Fleder places too much narrative nonsense on Douglas's shoulders, and the actor eventually just gives up and lets the genre's conventions take him to the safety of the end credits.  Director Gary Fleder is no stranger to the fall thriller game, having directed both ""Kiss The Girls"" and the rollicking ""Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead."" Not really an imaginative director, Fleder nevertheless can be counted on to get the job done. With ""Don't Say A Word,"" Fleder isn't working with a particularly good script, so he falls back on what has worked for him before. This plan of attack from Fleder leaves the picture stale and overtly familiar. The film is not interested in adding new elements to the plot to keep things at least appearing fresh. The end result making ""Don't Say A Word"" more boring than exciting.

The thriller, which is set in New York City, uses the city and apartment locations well, creating a nice sense of claustrophobia. It is when the action suddenly leaves the confines of the city and moves to a cemetery in a nearby island that the picture loses quite a bit of tension and interest. Moving to an obviously-a-soundstage cemetery ruins the fun of seeing the character freak out in their narrow apartments and office spaces. The film must end with a clich d showdown, which is the reason for the move to a different location, but Fleder makes a big mistake taking the story away from the grip of the big bad city.  The one element that Fleder does get right is the casting of actress Brittany Murphy. A powderkeg of emotions, Murphy is the perfect choice to play the deranged Elisabeth. Murphy is a grand talent (where is her Emmy for her voice work as Luanne Platter on ""King Of The Hill""?), and the only actress in Hollywood that truly achieves success as both a tormented patient and a cute, little princess (""Just Married"", ""Uptown Girls""). Unpredictable and bristling with untapped passions, Murphy makes a vivid impression in ""Don't Say A Word.""  You've seen this type of film before, and just because it's the time of year when apples taste the best doesn't make this barely alive thriller any more enjoyable. For fans of the genre, ""Don't Say A Word"" is another solid installment in the Michael Douglas versus New York crime saga. Just don't expect any surprises

1122,"	What a soundtrack. Too bad the movie couldn't keep up.
	This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. ""Saturday Night Fever"" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.

I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.

Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.

But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.

The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out ""the Limey"" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.

Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right (""Saturday Night Fever"" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame

1123,"	Hindsight is 20/20
	Believe it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I've seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts.

(I watched _Jacob's Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne's version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven't seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.) 

Flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you've never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song ""Maniac"" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in.

So, how was it?

Not too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob's Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book ""believe in your dreams"" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don't know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time.

I can't even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat.

Also, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!  Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since

	First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.  

Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.  

Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film. 

In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)

The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better

1129,"	Big name cast adds up to unfocussed dud. The worst movie of this genre.
	Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of ""Mississippi Burning"" or the anger and impunity of ""Ghosts of Mississippi"", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade ""Miss Congeniality"" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not ""a powerful film."" It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like ""Mississippis Burning,"" that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies

1130,"	Failed Miserably
	I went into this movie thinking it would be great to see a film set in the turbulent but interesting history of first settlements in the far north of Northern America. Having only really seen Pocahontas through the eyes of Disney, I felt this would be a good chance to see something more significant and engaging on one of histories more interesting events.

Like other reviewers, I found the photography and the scenery to be simply stunning. Visually, the film wows the viewer. The scenes simply amaze with their beauty, the sets with their majesty and also rustic simplicity. Coupled with the musical score, this was some of the best camera work I have seen in a long time. This was, in my opinion, the sole redeeming feature of the film.

While the filme attempted to contemplate serious and deep issues of love, allegiance and so on, it succeeded in only boring the tears out this viewer with the monotonous monologues of the characters done as long lengths of naration. In one part, the plot lost some continuity and needed reviewing to get to grips with what had happened.

For actors of the calibre of Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, this film did not show them at their best. Certainly not the worst I have seen by any stretch, but definitely not the best I have seen from either one of these actors.

Tread with caution on this one, and hire it before you buy it. I am glad I did not spend good money purchasing it. Quite frankly, it is a great cure for insomnia

	The New World is the least of Terrence Malick's limited filmography to date, and could be best described as a monotone poem. It's not exactly bad, just mundane and rather forgettable even while you're watching it, more of a self-indulgence than a genuine attempt to communicate with an audience. Visually it often seems surprisingly flat and uninspired, while the script comprises of far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections from his classical music collection, which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes the film evenly paced to the point where nothing can stand out: even the battle sequence takes time out for more musings. Another big problem is the miscasting of the inexplicably prolific Colin Farrell, a nice enough lad offscreen I'm sure but an extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry a picture no matter how many chances he's given. True to form he trots out his two `important picture' expressions - the Bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one and the one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he's not been getting enough roughage in his diet. The fact that he's outshone by Q'orianka Kilcher in her first speaking part speaks volumes of his inadequacy, although to be fair he has been worse. Indeed, among the male leads Christian Bale does much, much more with much, much less in the last third of the film, as does a typically underused Christopher Plummer in the first third. 

Malick is very good at the madness and mutiny that infects the deluded settlers of Jamestown, but because it happens to people we've barely been introduced to it carries no emotional or dramatic weight. If anything, it just made me think of how much more Herzog could have made of it all. Moments work, most notably the expulsion of the `Naturals' from their land and the brief latter sequences in England, but on the evidence of the 135-minute version I very much doubt Malick's promised longer cut will solve the problems. I know it's meant to be a work of art, but I just came away with the feeling that I'd watched an old and very average Universal International 50s Western redubbed by first-year philosophy students. The only surprise was that Jeff Chandler and his bouncing Basques didn't crop up.

	This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version.
Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie.
The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie.

1137,"	What's all the fuss about?
	Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.

There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.

The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.

The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.

In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex

1142,"	The Lisbon Suicides
	Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.

The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.

With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word ""death"" and the like.

Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.

After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke.
They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.

The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.

Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as ""Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation."") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as ""Elizabethtown"" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future

1148,"	Well that was tedious
	Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. (""Crash"" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would ""change the world"".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.

All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...  

And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch ""Trainspotting"", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as ""Requiem For A Dream"", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.  

""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over. 

Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.

Grade: D+

(""Crash"" comes close, but this film has many more critics than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they somehow imagined that it would ""change the world."") My opinion is not the same as that of most people who do not like the film: I do not care that it shows an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, and I do not find it overly depressing. The fact is, it's not depressing at all because I didn't care. It's just boring and annoying, sometimes in different moments, sometimes simultaneously. That's not a good combination. Well, here's a summary of the plot: Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and that really upsets their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is. The basic mistake is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain means nothing, and since it's only what's in this movie, it has absolutely no effect. Aronofsky might have put more time into characterization, but now there's just nothing left. As for the film, we have Jared Leto as a silly rogue who talks to his equally brash girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something. Then there's Jared's mother Ellen Burstyn, who's a strange old woman, and Marlon Wayans as Leto's boyfriend, who sometimes deals drugs with him and seems to be on his way to the big leagues. I love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans a person. He has a flashback about how he wanted to make his mother proud, and that's it. The doubly sad fact is that he is the most likable of the three. He shows at least a little bit of life."
1149,"	A Celebration of Hopelessness
	I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""KIDS"", ""Last Exit to Brooklyn"", and ""Traffic"".

	The only reason why I saw this was because of Susannah York. This shows she was more capable of the dix she played in  quot;The Killing of Sister George quot; and was a fine actress. Otherwise this movie is blah. It's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting. The men in this movie are so disgusting one can't blame her for getting mad anyway.

1152,"	A wild, wild gimmick
	You want realism of the Old West? Try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they didn't have tissues. Try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair, and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste, so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black.

THAT would be realistic, but it's a LOT more repellant to television audiences than gratuitous profanity. So this ""realistic"" show has characters with clean, fluffy hair and pretty teeth spew garbage langauge constantly -- and sucker viewers and reviewers buy this as ""realistic""!!! Every great writer of every age and era, be it Mark Twain, Owen Wister, William Shakespeare, or John Steinbeck, or any other storyteller whose works have survived for generations, told ""realistic"" stories of their era but who understood what realistic trivia to keep in, and what to leave out, in order to TELL THE STORY. That is WHY their work has remained timeless.

Deadwood's writing shows a huge insecurity complex in choosing to rely on a gimmick (and a juvenile one at that) like over-the-top profanity. Whether or not the Calamity Janes of the time actually used the words ""ignorant f****ng c***s"" is something we will never know and is also absolutely irrelevant.

There are an awful lot of sheeple in TV land

	OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.

The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?

1154,"	No Habeas, not much Corpus, and definitely not Delictus
	I hate lawyers.

What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. 

Shakespeare said it first and best: ""First, let's kill all the lawyers!"". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: ""get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"" 

Exactly. Anyway, ""The Firm"" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. 

But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. 

Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel ""The Firm"": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. 

I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?

What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. 

Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in ""The Firm"", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. 

Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and ""The Firm"" cried out for cinematic treatment. 

So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of ""The Firm"" is such a yawner. 

Talk about contempt of court.

Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, ""The Firm"" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. 

Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: ""The Firm"" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. 

Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. 

Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. 

Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.  

Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. 

If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. 

Otherwise, case dismissed.

1155,"	Did we see the same movie??
	Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole ""We're married and my husband's a doctor."" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and ""Dr. Holmes"" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?

What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.

Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?

Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us ""don't do it!"" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!

It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap

1156,"	Confusing, too many characters, difficult to follow story line
	Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the ""natural"" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk ""friend"" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.

All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie. 

Save your money, save your time, choose another movie.

1157,"	Not for the beginner
	I rented this DVD because of the glowing reviews here and because I wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the Middle East. Overall, I was disappointed by this offering because it didn't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject. (It also seems to me to be *a bit* biased in Israel's favor vis-a-vis the Palestinians, but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately.)

For instance, the documentary jumps right into the last Zionist Congress in 1939 (or whenever it was), but they never define what the Zionist movement is or where it came from. I know some of this from my reading, but it would be nice to have a summary here -- especially as it relates to the main players in the rest of the documentary. I wish the documentary would have at least started with WWI and the British occupation of Palestine after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, rather than picking up at WWII and mentioning some of the WWI details later. Doing so would have answered questions like, ""Why are the British so important here?""

Another example is keeping track of the people, places, and organizations, which are often named in Hebrew or Arabic and are unfamiliar to the uninitiated. It made the sequence of events hard to follow because we had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what and where. Using more text on the screen, more maps, more recaps, and perhaps more English translations would have improved things greatly, methinks.

The film certainly has value, not least because it is told by a participant and first-hand observer, but it is not for those without much familiarity with the people, places, and issues at hand

1162,"	maybe it just hasn't aged well...
	ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.

I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.

but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.

take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.

so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one

	The entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false.  The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents.  Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them ""again"" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply.

In movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK.  But this is a mainstream legal thriller.  It's like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don't, for no apparent reason.

But the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is

1167,"	Dry comedy for people who don't like dry comedy
	This show deserved to get cancelled, and there's a very simple reason.  This is supposedly dry, subtle comedy for people who don't usually like dry, subtle comedy.  It's a show that was presented to the FOX audience, an audeince that normally likes the most inane, low-brow kind of humor, that doesn't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it.

Meanwhile, to people who actually appreciate subtlety and dry humor, the so-called comedy in the show is unbelievably obvious and predictable.  Every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke, it's clear how forced and contrived it is, how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor, something they clearly don't understand.  It's embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch, because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat.  It's just an awkward mess.

But those aren't the people this show is targeted at.  It's targeted at that FOX audience who has never even seen dry humor before, and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them.  They think this show is brilliant because it's a little smarter than MAD TV, or at least thinks it is.  And since those are the people who are seeing the show, you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is.  If the show were on HBO or some other network, exposed to a different kind of audience, you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works.

So why did this show get cancelled, when so many people think it's so amazing?  If it's so great, people would have actually watched it, right?  So where were the ratings?  The fact is, the people who love this show are a very vocal minority.  The audience for dry humor didn't watch this show because it's not funny.  But the audience who was fooled by this show, as vocal as they are, was just too small:  they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it.

This is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for TV, as its apologists claim.  No, it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes

1168,"	contrived, implausible crime drama
	""Four Brothers"" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty ""Boyz n the Hood"" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.  

The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.

The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.  

With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, ""Four Brothers"" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.

To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the ""cheesiness"" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way.

	Sixth Sense   Unbreakable are so much better than Signs, and I'm sorry to say whatever M. Night Shyamalan originally had, he's lost. When Sixth Sense came out, he was tipped as the next big thing, but I'm sorry to say, it's no longer there. In my mind, he cannot match any films up to the success and sheer uniqueness of Sixth Sense.

Signs just fails miserably. The concept was a good idea, but the execution was terrible. It reminded me very much of Blair Witch Project, as in what little action there was happens off screen, and the torches as well. It's also definitely not Mel Gibson's best film. Even the actors appear to struggle with the dialogue-heavy script, and not really much happens. Apart from one brief glimpse of an alien. Oooh. Fascinating.

The problem I think that Signs has, is that it's already following many other, far superior, alien movies. Aliens attacking the earth has been done, and lots more memorable than this. There's also the overly religious theme, which the film probably would have done better either toning down, or scrapping altogether. It was really just thrown in to try and justify what was happening in the film. The scenes between Gibson and his kids and his brother are way too sentimental and really cringeworthy.

The finale doesn't really make the film better. The discovery that the naked aliens find water like acid to their skin is atrocious! Why come to earth, the surface of is mostly covered in water, and the atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour?! And then they travel millions of light years with far advanced technology - and then can't break into a wooden house?! Are you kidding me? But the most ridiculous thing is not only do the characters not pay attention to the dogs, who sensed something was not right (time to get myself a dog), but the fact that all the sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect the aliens entering our atmosphere - but a BABY MONITOR can?! Huh?!

A film to stay well away from. Thankfully, I didn't spend my hard earned (ha!) money on it, but borrowed it from a friend. I shall approach M. Night Shyamalan's films with trepidation from now. Oh, and when a director decides to give himself a speaking role in his own film, make it a SHORT one

	As an environmental scientist, I find these soft-science/hardball political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful. While they rally the convinced, having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful. To wit, about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage. 

About the ""movie"": it's actually a filmation of the presentation Al Gore has made for some time on Global Warming. In it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of man-made CO2 and other green-house gasses. The audience is bombarded with a long series of charts, graphs, and suppositions that make for a compelling argument - IF one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation.

And this is where this production goes terribly wrong, the fact checking was terrible, the cherry-picked data was obvious and heavy-handed, and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause. Two examples: 

An Inconvenient Truth asserts that a sea-level rise of 20 feet is a realistic short-term prospect - yet, the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the Western nations warns of sea-level rise in the four to 35 inches range in the 21st century.

Gore discusses the Earth's atmosphere as relatively thin, and declares that, ""The problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide."" Hello? Thickness has nothing to do with global warming people. Carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from Earth's surface - meaning that the vibration warms the CO2, which makes things hotter. Further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense, since it doesn't play a role.

My warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process, no matter how noble the cause may be.

So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.

1187,"	What a snooze fest.
	It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time.  This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame.

It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson.  Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half.  The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty.  Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean.  The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE!  It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene.

Most of the ""women"" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her.  Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I get it Jackson was ""such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual"" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that.  A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly.  

Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares.  

There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film.  I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been.  A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige.

If you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart.

Gettysburg is much better.  I actually missed Sheen and I hate that guy

1190,"	Does not hold our attention
	Let me start off by saying that I have higher degrees in art, art history, music, and Romance languages -- so I am an admitted ""art snob."" Having said that, I would recommend that you try the Baby Einstein ""Baby Van Gogh, World of Colors"" and ""Baby Mozart"" videos instead of this Brainy Baby video.

I find this Brainy Baby video to be slow, boring, insipid, condescending, and visually uninteresting; I cannot wait to put in something else. Wait, you say, isn't this about the baby who is watching it? Well, I first realized that it is truly boring (and not ""just me"") by watching my 6-month-old's reaction to it. (She is now 10 months old, and still does not like it.) She consistently snubbed her nose at this video; she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do. She has never had this reaction to the Einstein videos I mentioned.

I tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old, thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better, but after 4 months of this approach, she still is not interested. However, the Einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning, and still do.

Here are the specifics that I think are the problem. The visuals are weak and not bold/colorful enough. My daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys. The female voice-over is distracting and annoying, rather than engaging and instructional as intended. The flow is not as coherent as the Einstein videos, which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video. There is no charm or sense of humor, like the Einstein videos.

No, I do not have any connection whatsoever to the Baby Einstein folks. I'm just saying that the Brainy Baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging. If you're going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby, buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together

1192,"	Tolerable, but not really very good movies
	My friend bought this set and so I was able to view it before purchasing it myself, and I WON'T be purchasing it. I had seen The Long, Long Trailer before and it was one of the most aggrivating movies I have ever seen; one of those films where you can't believe 2 people could be so dumb to do some of the things they do. We enjoy most of the I Love Lucy series, but there is a point where you can only take so much of those shows; the aggrivating ones, and this film was just an overly long aggrivating I Love Lucy episode. There is funny humor and aggrivating ""humor"" and this was definitely the 2nd type. 

Yes, it was interesting to see Lucy and Desi doing films together, but overall these films are just tolerable, and none are ones I would rewatch for enjoyment. Too Many Girls was definitely a B picture, really really bad in so many ways...poorly written script, cheap scenery; you never got the feeling they were in college, except at the football game, which seemed so similar to the football game the Marx Brothers participated in in Horse Feathers! Too much partying, singing, dancing; what was this school majoring in, theatre and opera?  It just is a really bad picture. Yes, neat to see Lucy and Desi and how they met, and see them so young together, but otherwise, a real time waster in my mind. The funniest thing on this disc was the cartoon extra!

Of the three, Forever, Darling is probably the best but again that seemed ""lacking"" somewhere. The color was that beautiful almost surreal 50's color that I like. The Yosemite scenery was beautiful too. But I think the angel stuff could have been much better developed; he was out of the scene too long at times. The part I liked best was Lucy imagining herself in the movie with James Mason because it was quite funny. But the camping trip was just a very predictable mishap time that was too much in the I Love Lucy mold and I was bored with it quickly.

I know die hard fans of Lucy and Desi will buy this no matter what, and that's fine. But for others, I advise you see them first...you may like them, but then you may see them for what they really are cinematically. There are lots better movies out there that I would rather buy! I Rate these 2 stars; one star to me is ""torturous"" to watch. These aren't THAT bad, but almost.

(And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a ""nude scene"" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.

It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse. 

The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.

	Okay, it's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion.  It does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis.  On the other hand, the film lacks true suspense.  I was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn.  The baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum.  The pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn't stand up that well today.  The actors who took part in this didn't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel.  Why there was a sequel is beyond me.  I recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but I was only five at the time.  At the most this is a rent not a buy.  I guess good for it's time but perhaps a re-make would pump some needed life into the story.

1198,"	Aims low and hits its target
	This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go ""undercover"" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in ""Lethal Weapon""), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.

1204,"	The Character of Martha Dunstock
	Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha. 

Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.

The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.

For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making.

	How High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large.  I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech   Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing.  While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be.  When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clichï¿½s that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society.  While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture.  I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times.  The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face.  Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clichï¿½s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film.  Nothing was original.  Nothing was exciting.

Was the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions?  I think not.  As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought.  Why?  Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film.  With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters.  That is why they failed as a comic team.  Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech   Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned?  What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together.  Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same.  I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive.  What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters.  The clichï¿½ jock, the clichï¿½ frat boy, the clichï¿½ Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the clichï¿½ rich white boy, just felt and were old.  Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality.  How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original.

I must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don't want to go to Harvard.  They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage.  How High is a dark spot in Harvard's history.  Do you know what makes it even worse?  This film wasn't even created at or anywhere near Harvard.  Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film.  How High has no redeeming qualities.  Ooops, I stand corrected.  The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke.  How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film?  I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid.  Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud.  What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing.  There is no original story at all with How High.  Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a ""cut and paste"" film that had no backbone and horrid acting!

I do not like Jesse Dylan's style of directing.  While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes.  The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example.  The Benjamin Franklin moments is another.  The unconcluded ""Truth Serum"" can be considered another.  How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency.  Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated!  I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan.  If he would have tightened the script, created unique and ""cult-like"" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential ""weed"" film in Hollywood.  Now, all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for.  Sad.

Overall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed.  Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High.  The actors, all around, were horrible.  The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy.  Nothing was funny.  Nothing will make you laugh.  The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits.  The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life.

	...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.  

John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.  

A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.  

It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.  

It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.

	Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.  

As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a ""star"" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of ""cool"" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.  

The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.

Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth

In PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the film's attempt to turn teenagers into martyrs and make all adults look like careless idiots only underscores why so many adults view teenagers with contempt. The teenagers in this film seem to have little respect for authority, and their association with being tortured and misunderstood is undermined in their youthful behavior. Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people one-on-one; he instead chooses to be a kind of redemption for his teenagers by using his pirated radio broadcasts to spark a sort of insurrection among them. As a truth-seeker, he is an empty contrast to the truth: he feigns masturbation to awaken the young; he does not use his real name or his real voice; and when he calls a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who is not serious and never really comforts. The suicidal teenager says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his family structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his death? The adults are almost depicted as caricatures and the teenagers as misunderstood heroes.

1214,"	If I want to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas
	Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.

I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English (""Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?"") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.   

To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of ""...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..."" or ""...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..."" but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.

Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!  

To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive

	For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man.

Facts:
In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times!

In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie.

Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame.

Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.

We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.

Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.

Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.

I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.

1227,"	The Plot Successfully Escaped
	HART'S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.  

Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.  

In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.  

If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart's unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.

HART'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.   A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection

	The movie ""Dead Life"" by director William Victor Shotten is a throwback to the great movies of old such as Night of the Living Dead--or at least it tries to be--unfortunately it's a stupid attempt and being original through looking old, which in itself is an irony.

Looking at its writing, there's absolutely nothing to commend this movie on. Though this movie at least tries to give you an explanation as to the existence of zombies, it's as thought-out as a cat's decision to chase a shiny object. The common mistake made with Romero's films is that the story wasn't well thought out, since they never really explain the zombies (except a bit in the original about a meteor); however, what people don't realize is it doesn't matter why. Romero's films are satirical in nature, they focus on a larger picture and disregard details, that's what makes them so great--that's what makes them films.

Dead Life makes some attempt and showing depth with its underlying theme, except it's stupid and unoriginal, and really not shocking or thought-provoking in the slightest.

This movie is not shocking, it's not realistic, even the ""gore scene"" everyone is referring to is only a stupid attempt at being shocking and over-the-edge; but it comes off as just being tasteless.

People are giving this movie credit for having no money, but really, people have done better with less. The acting is ridiculous, the sound is poorly dubbed, the camera is always out of focus, and the special effects are lame. It is a tasteless zombie romp with no point whatsoever, it doesn't deserve credit for having a low budget, it makes no effort to make people think and makes no effort to be good, period. Night of the Living Dead was a low-budget film, this is not even close to reaching that level.

Oh, and it actually takes sound effects straight from the first Resident Evil game and dubs them in. Seriously

Here's my problem, they could have at least paid more attention to the camera focus, most scenes were blurred, every now and then the focus was clear, I mean c'mon, when I was fourteen I did a short stop motion animated movie with an old Bell and Howell Super 8 camera and even then I paid attention to the focus. Okay, enough of that, now for the professionals of the film. The make-up fx was good and there is a scene that will make most MEN wink, the exterior and some interior settings had a NOTLD feel.

	For years, I've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low-budget horror movies, but I'd rather watch ANYTHING shot on video than watching the waste of film that is Dead Life. Don't be fooled when I say this movie is shot on film. It SERIOUSLY looks like it was shot on a 1950s 8mm camera. It's perpetually grainy, dark, fuzzy, and shaky, and not in an artsy way. My $200 video camera looks infinitely better than this. The video quality is appropriate, however, as it's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this stink-fest. The sound is murky and undecipherable, the acting is strictly amateur hour, the characters are paper-thin with no distinction or purpose, the story is non-existent, the dialogue is a completely worthless bore, there's nothing remotely scary, and the special effects (including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a Commodore 64) are laughable. Or, at least, I wish they were laughable. That would've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this (high school) student film. It's movies like this -- cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy, but which get cherry spots on Blockbuster shelves because they're packaged with slick cover art -- that give horror movies in general (and zombie movies in particular) a bad name, and that make horror fans so wary. Disgraceful!

There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess.

1244,"	rambling and unfocused drama
	""Kings and Queen"" is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.  

The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie.  The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live.  The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party.  After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.

With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, ""Kings and Queen"" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships.  It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching.  But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on.  Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over.  For instance, Nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours.  Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father.  Nora could be accused of being  confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place?  I don't think so.

Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom.  But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here.  This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.

So Nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a scathing diatribe against his daughter's character, which simply does not match the woman we have been seeing for a good two hours. Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (who is that again? ), but she certainly does not deserve the insults her father has hurled at her. One could accuse Nora of being confused, indecisive, sometimes a bit inward-looking, but evil enough to have her father who wishes he could give her his cancer and let her die in his place?

1245,"	How To Make A Goth/Sci-Fi ""Classic"" (A 20-Step Guide)
	1. Make sure you set your film in some sort of terrible alternate future where all people are slaves or unhappy or kept under sedation or something.

2. Have every scene take place in the dark.  And your underworld must be lit by 15-watt bulbs.

3. Clothe everyone in black leather, particularly capes.  This especially works for the villains, but in the interest of equal play the heroes can be edgy and wear black leather too.  If they're villains, shave their heads.  Give them sunglasses (for the dark!)

4. Copying Terry Gilliam's masterpiece Brazil, throw something retro like brimmed fedoras into the wardrobe.

5. Have a premise where our hero, a lone, semi-geeky guy, wakes up or somehow finds himself in a world he does not remember getting into.  He must clear his name of something, even if it's just getting off Pottery Barn's mailing list.

6. Have a Mysterious Woman who may or may not be in cohoots with the bad guys, but who falls in love with our hero and wants to save him by the end of act II.

7. Make damn sure she's sultry.  Though blondes are generally more popular these days in Hollywood, here dark brunettes work best.

8. Have lots of issues that revolve around our brains being dicked with.  Throw in lots of tortured dialogue about alternative consciousnesses/universes/fuel supplies/sugar substitutes.

9. This is very important: USE THE RHETORICAL LINE AT LEAST ONCE: ""DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU [find the Kiber Crystal/try to rescue your love-interest/defy Dr. Morphface/turn on a bright light]?""  Indeed he (and we) don't.  This is supposed to get us all scared and anxious.

10. Our hero should have had, if possible, a happy childhood that turned tragic.  Slaughtered parents work great here.  Of course, he doesn't remember any of it, at least at first.

11. Populate your world with lots of machines with tubes, wires, cables, and ducts.  There also should be flashes of lightning that serve no purpose.

12. Make sure your sets and costumes were ""derived"" from some black and white classic film from the 20s or 30s--Metropolis, Caligari, even Frankenstein will do nicely.  This is both to show you have a ""legitimate pedigree"" and to cover up the fact that you have no original ideas yourself.

13. Make sure all the bad guys bite off their dialogue and sound mean.  This is how we know they are bad guys, since lately both sides have been wearing black leather.

14. The guy gets the girl in the end and the sun comes out.  Really now, do we have to say this??? (However, through most of the movie we must believe the love will be unrequited.  The dame should have a troubled history, though you must keep it vague.)

15. Throw in some cyborgs.  You gotta have cyborgs. 

16. Have sets that are about fifteen times larger than they need to be, but which are largely empty.

17. There's always the authority figure who starts out in pursuit of our guy, but who by the end becomes convinced of his innocence and moves to his side.

18. There was some vague, recent apocalyptic event that destroyed most of civilization.  But be brief here.  Our audience may get to wondering how one guy saving one girl will restore all of civilization, and you don't want them thinking about that.

19. Include a sadomasochistic scene or two.  The current favorite is to strap the victim spread-eagled on a rotating mechanical device and stick him with needles.  This movie likes to stick them through the bone at the front of the skull, a really stupid place to insert a needle (but then, this screenwriter clearly isn't a brain surgeon).

20. Always have a big shoot-em-up climax with lots of explosions, steam, smoke, distorting of the picture with computer tricks, and loud rock music.  This is how we resolve things when we have no idea what the hell we're talking about or how to end the movie.  We hope nobody notices.  Generally they don't.

But wait, I'll still be releasing $100 from EMI to release all the videos on DVD, or do we have to go underground to get them from someone who tapped them and sold them. I can only say that the Internet was invented for information exchange programs. If they patiently protect this historic document from the people, they will share it over the Internet. The video doesn't belong to a company, it belongs to the world, the world created it and EMI believes it is by restricting it. I'm so sick of it and I'm sick of this complete b $% # # $T. No one should be content with that, I demand more and everyone should demand more. 3 billion people watched 1 million viewers. And what does EMI say, they will put together the shittiest DVD and then get everyone to download the videos from their website. I think I will find them all and publish them in Wikipedia, because it is not a person who owns the creation of the world. Anyone who believes in it should know what it means to them to go to AFrica for every extra cent of this DVD and it's a bloody disgrace. All I can say is that I make sure that this continues in every review for this damn DVD until something is done about it."

1248,"	This film was not faithful to the adaptation of the novel.
	There's lots of passion in Wide Sargasso Sea THE BOOK, but it's mostly emotional. It's an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master. The film on the other hand is just your classic, bad 1990s film, beautiful to look at, with lots of skin, languid copulation, heaving bosoms, bodice-ripping nonsense, etc and next to no substance. It has no artistic integrity whatsoever, as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the Jean Rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did.

I was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character. The much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe, and it also lacked much enthusiasm. They were incomplete and contributed little, if anything, to the plot. The viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between Edward and Antoinette. Therefore, they should have either gone all the way, tastefully (no pun intended), or have left those scenes out entirely. 

Now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes, which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book. But for those who haven't read the book, there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat. From the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family (despite the narration). Why did the ex-slaves keep laughing? (Something vaguely explained in the movie, though apparently fully explained in the book). Why didn't the parrot fly away? What made the mother go nuts? At no point in the movie were Mr. Rochester's ""issues"", as it were, fully explained. The man gets a letter exposing his wife as a Creole and dumps her like a hot potato, after (as Christophene explains) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place. What a hypocrite. Again, maybe this is the ultimate point, that Mr. Rochester is a snob and the archetypical Victorian Englishman and that Antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the Jamaicans. But none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film. 

So, despite the beautiful cinematography, this movie is a hopeless muddle. I'd highly recommend the novel by the way: a book you don't forget in a hurry. Needless to say I think you should give this insulting (to the memory of Jean Rhys) film a miss, especially if you've read the novel: it'll just frustrate you, no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time.

	24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way. 

My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste. 

Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into.

Exorcist 3, which I was equally disappointed in, at least was more satanic.  I won't spoil anything for those who do want to see it, but the showdown scene between Depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed.  Emmanuelle Seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a Demona. And the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least.  This film could have been great but Polanski dropped the ball, considering he was the producer/director/co-screenwriter, and the film fails in all three areas. It's not horrible, so I give it 2 stars.  But don't buy this film, rent it only.  Buy Angel Heart instead

But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those `experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs.

1271,"	Do Musicians have a conscience....?
	Following Live 8 i have to wonder if Live Aid justifies the euphoria that followed it. Most people if honest would say that on the whole musically it was pretty bland and as for achieving its aims-well that's debatable. What it did manage to do was make Bob Geldof whom no matter how honourable his motive were done quite nicely out of it thank you. Before this his career was on the skids and now he is a household name, knighted by the monarchy and very,very rich. The same with U2 pushed them into the statosphere and made Bono think he is some sort of latter day prophet. Same with Queen pushed them into mega-stardom. So do musicians have a conscience or was it the chance to get maximum worldwide publicity, push their latest album all for fifteen minutes of stage time. Sounds pretty good to me. One can't help wonder that they could all give there royalties for the past year and wipe out the third world debt without coming on stage and screaming 'give me your money'. There was a shot(deleted of course) where backstage the good and the great were dining on expensive food and wine whilst up on stage was a backdrop of the starving. Another example of there hyprocrisy. Madonna singing 'imagine' on her latest tour '..imagine-no prosessions..yeah right! I can't help but think for all there posturing there was an eye on global exposure and a chance to feel good about themselves when they went back to their mansion and who would dispute that McCartneys version of 'let it be' was stomach churning? Face it the only musician (Peter Green ex-fleetwood mac) who wanted to give everything away to charity got certified. Proves a point

1272,"	Review
	""Capote"", directed by Bennett Miller with a conscious sensation of subtlety and a slow pace, was widely acclaimed by critics after its release in 2005. It is based on Gerald Clarke's 1988 non-fiction book ""Capote: A Biography"". The film starts by Capote's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) interest in the Kansas crime merely as a reader and ends with him becoming the most famous writer on the crime. His knowledge of the criminals, especially Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.), which started from the newspapers elevated to an intimate yet undefined relationship. The writer is sympathetic and sees in Smith a strong resemblance with himself, yet he uncaringly and mendaciously uses him to get to his aim. Capote was looking for something to write and indeed he found it. ""In Cold Blood"" was his most famous novel; the one that established him as a legendary writer. He was left overwhelmed, confused and unsatisfied, however. The movie is quite ambiguous, though. Characters are marginally defined and the dialogue wavers between witty to irrelevant or inexpressive. At many instances it is hard to grasp the causes and consequences of specific situations and conversations. For instance, people are always laughing heartily at what Capote has to say, although he never actually says something funny or worth a great deal of laughter. The setting and the music were both barely significant. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance is highly remarkable, the actor's resemblance of Capote is questionable. Hoffman is 5'10"" and more stout than the slender, barely 5'2"" Truman Capote.

1273,"	An amateur effort all around
	This movie is utterly unremarkable -- actually, scratch that.  This movie is actually VERY remarkable -- because of how BAD it is.  First of all, the protagonist is pathetic: it's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful, weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems; all she does is cry and moan.  Second, the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers I've seen in any movie.  Third, there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered, which disrupt the movie's flow and continuity; for example, the protagonist gets hit head-on by an 18-wheeler truck, and her car is absolutely mangled, but she walks away without a scratch.  Someone care to explain how that's possible?

I probably would have stopped watching this piss-poor excuse for a movie if I wasn't at a friend's house (and there's the fact that it's his movie): I sat through it just to be polite.  When all is said and done, this movie just isn't worth your time.  I'm glad I'm not the one who actually paid my hard-earned dollars to buy this piece of dung

	rent it but by all means don't buy it.  you won't watch it more than once.  this movie is not for those who have invested 25+ hours into the tv show.  although you will better understand what's going on if you have seen the show, none of this will really seem new or interesting to you.  you learn some new facts about Bob and The Man from Another Place, but nothing important.  for the most part it just tells the story as we have already pieced together from the show, adding only pointless and unrealistic new occurances (Bobby kills someone, Donna is replaced by an new actor, Coop forsees all the future comings of Laura's murder, etc).  all of the twin peaks charm that you have come to love is gone and the movie really suffers from that.  you can't only give Coop 10 meaningless lines and expect the show to succeed.  i think Lynch's efforts would have been more successful and greatly appreciated if he had made a sequel to the second series, focusing on the complications of Coop being in the Black Lodge, Harry having an emotional attachment to Coop but being forced to bring him down, etc.

i guess if you have never seen the series this may be more interesting, but i dont really think so.  overall, the look and the feel was very foreign and uncomfortable and it moved very slow.  it is somewhat of a letdown coming from a monster writer/director like Lynch.  i'm glad i've seen it, but hell, i'd rather watch dune again before this

	I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming.  But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you.  

See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.

Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.

1285,"	Not That great, actually is kinda bad.
	Dont get me wrong, i'm kinda young but i love 80's / 90's movies specially the horror ones.  I had great spectation for early Geoge Romero movies. But both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad. Gorge Romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry, but for today standars they are not, even they are not that good for most of the 80's 90's movies.

The Bad:

1. Acting is not beleavible. It looks like the were ""acting""
2. The dialog's are not how people actually talk.
3. The soldiers at ""Day Of The Dead"" are a shame, they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline. They behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups

4. More than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other.
5. I think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans (listening music, shooting, ""talking"" )
6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment. Theres is not any frightening atmosfere .

The Good:

1. The gore scenes are really good, maybe too much bloody. It shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated.


So far the only great zombie movie i have seen, beleive it or not is Resident Evil 1.
Resident Evil 1 has it all. Resident Evil 2 NOT. Resident Evil 2 is one those ""just shoot and kick"" movies and I'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo.  

So if you want a gory movie, maybe you may like this movie, but the gore is just at the end of the movie. You will be better pleased with ""Cabin Fever"".

If you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe Resident Evil 1, Poltergeist, the original japanese version of The Ring and The Grouch, ScareCrows. Alien, Aliens and even Alien 3 not Alien 4 (It Sucks).

	I picked this set up despite reservations (reservations being Luke Perry and the guy from the Cosby Show) because of the creator J. Michael Straczynski. Unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff. 

It's really nothing more then a C average show. Normally that's not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel (Showtime) and costs over $70.00 on DVD it's just not good enough. 

Specific problems I had with the show include a lot of filler episodes. The season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line. The show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story (this is the model that HBO uses). 

Production value is also sorely lacking. Once again I'm going to compare to HBO (I feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks). The HBO series Carnivale has unbelievable production value, the set's, locations, costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality (the same can be said for Deadwood and Rome but Carnival makes for a better comparison). But Jeremiah all looks the same. You can tell the show was all shot in the same location, every back road and town look like they are in the same county.

The biggest problem however is just the premise. A post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get's tired fast. I had to force myself through the last 9 episodes. Luke Perry's quest to find Valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery. Simon's quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled. So basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent. Plus if you need any other reason to dislike this show then know that Jason Presley makes a guest appearance (just what this show needed a 90210 reunion).

If you're looking for a great show this is not it. If you can watch it cheap give a whirl but don't waste any hard earned cash on this one

But Jeremiah looks the same. You notice that the series was all shot in the same place, every side street and every town looks like they are in the same county. The biggest problem, however, is just the premise. A post-genocide world populated by orphaned children seems a good idea, but in practice it quickly grows tired. I had to squeeze through the last nine episodes. Luke Perry's quest for the Valhalla sector is not a matter of intrigue or mystery."

	""The human race today is in a really bad state, mainly because most people do not want to wake up. They want to be told how to behave instead of understanding their own power."" -- Miceal Ledwith in The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions

I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD ""What the BLEEP Do We Know!?"" mostly for the engaging snippets of dialogue from scientists, theologians, and mystics. I also enjoyed Ramtha's DVD ""Create Your Day"", even though it wasn't quite as good as the BLEEP cameos. 

It was with great expectations that I viewed The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions by Miceal Ledwith. Unfortunately, the plodding pace of the 57 minute DVD--as well as the ramblings of Ledwith--was very disappointing.

Ledwith brings up some great points in this DVD, but never goes beyond the surface. He asserts that thinking people have discarded most of the infantile tenants of the ""hamburger universe"" (i.e. the ""vault of the heavens"" overhead with the vault of hell underneath). Yet, instead of treating his audience as intelligent folk, he makes nebulous comments without explaining the ""what and why"".

He mentions string theory (quantum physics) and the ""true"" nature of the big bang, going on to say that levitation isn't a ""miracle"" but only a matter of superseding gravity with the ""Torsion Field"". The problem is that he's tossing about these terms in support of Jesus' words that ""ye are all gods"" and ""greater works than these shall you do"" without actually explaining the meaning or *science* of a Torsion Field and just how consciousness supersedes natural laws. (FYI: The Torsion Field is quantum spin waves of empty space. Einstein and Elie Cartan did some preliminary work on this theory in the 1920's. The Einstein-Cartan theory could possibly be used to explain ESP, among other things.)

Ledwith spends a good portion of the DVD highlighting the silliness of traditional Christianity, including the clouds and harps of heaven. He goes on and on about how a cloud is, in reality, damp and would be uncomfortable to sit on (duh) and that if one were to play the harp for eternity, they'd wear down the fingers to the third knuckle. I understand highlighting the damage that traditional Christian thought has caused humanity, especially in terms of evolution. In fact, as a former minister trained in theology myself, I probably ""get it"" more than most.

But while poking fun at Christian thought is popular these days, you had *better* have some theological and scientific claims to back up your assertions--especially if you want to be a part of the ""thinking"". Christian apologists know their Bible inside and out, so if Ledwith wants to undermine their fear-based, illogical ideas he needs to do so with his supposed area of expertise...THEOLOGY. Heck, even at a simplified level, all one has to do is consider that if an individual set a paddle on fire and repeatedly hit a baby with it over and over and over, this act would be considered a barbaric tragedy condemned by Christians (and others, of course). 

Yet, God the Father would do much worse by condemning humanity to eternal torment forever and ever? Apologists would say ""Well, humans CHOOSE to go to hell."" The interesting thing is that the Bible says ""no man can come to the Father except the Holy Spirit draws him"" because his understanding is ""darkened"". 

This is just one of the many points that Ledwith could bring up, but instead, he preaches to the New Age choir by ridiculing monotheistic religions (primarily Christianity) via nebulous assertions. In fairness, Ledwith makes excellent points, but nothing that you couldn't get (much more eloquently) from Marianne Williamson, Gary Zukav, Eckhart Tolle, Neale Donald Walsch, and others. Some of these points are:

""We are pawns tossed about by those people we perceive as more capable and enlightened than us.""

""If Jesus were on Earth today, he wouldn't recognize his own teachings.""

""Anyone who looks back at our history can only be appalled at the small-mindedness, the hostility, the barbarism that has characterized our whole traverse as a race.""

""We don't realize how following another's image of God is spiritually and evolutionarily limiting. We don't even think of it.""

""The flat earth mentality still corrupts and completely distorts our fundamental beliefs at the basic level still today.""

""We've never gotten rid of the Inquistatorial mind to this day.""

""The answers we've been given by religion are bizarre, emotionally charged, and childish.""

""Heaven varies according to the broker (Christian denomination), but the basis is pretty much the same: earning credits for good behavior so you can immigrate to heaven.""

""God is just a human magnified (in monotheism). We take these categories from the lowest plains of existence and impose them upon the Divine. As a result, we're left with something so sentimental, mawkish, and inaccurate that it bears no relationship to reality.""

""Whatever God is has no gender. These childish images are holding us back.""

Ledwith makes other interesting comments, but they beg for elaboration. One such comment is:

""(That) Jesus' death was to appease the vengeance of a savage God...this had NOTHING to do with what Jesus Christ did.""

I'd love to hear his explanation of the crucifixion! Spiritual teachers such as Williamson have brilliantly explained the metaphysical aspects of the crucifixion of Christ. Does Ledwith have a clue as to why Jesus died? If he did, why didn't he share it?

He quotes Jesus by saying ""greater works (than I) shall you do"", attempting to make the case that humans are living far below their potential--mostly due to a flat earth mentality. What he fails to mention, however, is that polemicists and theologians debate the meaning of ""greater works"" (meizona tout n in the Greek) in terms of whether ""greater"" refers to quantity versus quality. (My Greek professor made a case for the former, saying that converts would multiply miracles by sheer numbers.)

Ledwith also perpetuates the biggest misquote circulated in New Age circles, attributing ""It's not our weakness that frightens us, it's our power"" to Nelson Mandela. The actual quote is ""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure..."", which was uttered by Marianne Williamson in her book ""A Return to Love"".

One of Ledwith's comments that I found particularly insightful is ""As human knowledge grows, the territory of God shrinks. God becomes a refugee."" The ""God of the gaps"", as he called it, are areas that we try to fill with human knowledge in the attempt to explain what we don't yet understand. An example would be ancient paganism attributing lightning to the actions of Zeus. Despite this interesting observation, it's not enough to enliven the rest of the DVD.

What separates the tight, insightful segements in ""What the BLEEP Do We Know!?"" from this DVD is that the conversations captured in BLEEP were the result of directors Chasse, Arntz and Vincente ASKING probing questions of the experts...questions borne out of the directors' own curiosity and personal paths. On The Great Questions in the Hamburger Universe, Vol. 1 of Deep Deceptions, however, Ledwith is left to ramble at the camera rather aimlessly, which doesn't make for good viewing and does not offer lucid alternatives to the flat earth mentality of the hamburger universe. Perhaps this is more the fault of ""director"" JZ Knight.

In the end, I couldn't help but feel like this DVD was thrown together in order to capitalize on BLEEP's popularity. Let's hope the subsequent installments of this series are tighter, deeper, and smarter

	Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books. 

However, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.

The DVD will probably be a good value for those who read the above books. But as a stand-alone video or as a video about the Da Vinci Code, it is simply not successful. The narrator Lincoln takes us through the picturesque and beautiful landscape of Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian crusade, and points out some interesting details during his walk. But he rarely ties the details together to create a coherent picture, and often makes comments that seem to undermine the notion that he intends to create a coherent picture. He also delights in showing the destruction many of these mysterious details have been wrought by treasure hunters and vandals (many of whom seem to be inspired by Lincoln's books), and repeatedly writes editorials against their actions. I eventually fell asleep for about 90 minutes - I can't imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to continue roaring through the remaining half hour."

	I go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this DVD to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if I didn't want to leave the house.  I was a little disappointed in this DVD.  I love Self Magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising.  The routines are broken down into four separate workouts.  The only one that involved any effort on my part was the Pilates-inspired section.  As for the rest, the other sections would have you do too few reps, I felt, to get your muscles warmed up, let alone reshape them.  I think this DVD is great for beginners.  Its simple enough to follow and it won't scare you away too soon.  But if you're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine, this probably isn't the abs workout for you

	I was a huge fan of the books growing up, and a lover of the period and Jannette Oke's books. I had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series. Well, I just finished -- and could hardly stop from yawning while I watched!  

The movie started out well enough.  Wonderful filming, great costuming, glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time.  No, the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie.

The scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch.  I remembered the tomboyish Missie from the last film and couldn't wait to see her older.  The actress portraying the older Missie just did not do her justice! While she was pretty, she read most of her lines flat, with little emotion.  The worst was the very ending, which was supposed to have been a heart-breaking moment between father and daughter, instead fell completely flat.  In fact, most of the scenes with Missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left.

I think there were several attempts to portray Missie as spirited (like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant), but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid Missie we were continually seeing.  

Apart from that, the rest of the cast was average, with a few star moments here and there.  I can't remember the book very well to check for accuracy, but the story was so-so as well -- melodrama only reared its head in a few places.  

Only if you want to keep up-to-date with the series, I would recommend this.  Otherwise, I'm glad they replaced Missie's actress for the next film.  Perhaps we'll get to see a more energetic performance.

	Francisco was right, this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust.

The review on the back of the dvd says ""jaw dropping, "" but the full quote probably reads ""jaw dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)"". There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters, ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant ""evil side of human nature"" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don't watch zombie movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice's How To pamphlet and said ""yeah, it needs some CONFLICT"". If these characters weren't so constipated and bloated I'd give them a chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of ""social commentary,"" but that's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully. It wasn't.  You'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director's real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely undead. The rest is monotonous dreck.   I don't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man's dramatic rags. 

All that aside, the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads. Sorry, but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron.

there shouldn't be a movie that tries to help guys get girls. the movie title ""what women want"" was just wrong. i bet many guys thought of it as the gateway to seriously improving their game if they're looking for a date.


i personally think guys put way too much emphasis on trying to find out what women want. i don't think that should be necessary. i think it's ridiculous. i think the guy should be himself like the girl is practially all the time and just feel good about himself. not every girl is going to be into every guy... i think self-confidence is probably the most important thing for a guy to have when trying to get women.

A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?

Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.

Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.

	What do we do
When first started watching wrestling in my early teens, Ric Flair was a hero of mine, he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever. 

So when this DVD came out I got it immediately, hoping to relive my youth, but I realized something. All the matches are the same, there long and dull, the same moves are done over and over, and the matches only pick up when Flair opponent takes the advantage. There is nothing wrong with long matches, if that are done well, like the Iron man match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long, so it can show Flairs endurance. 

I also noticed Flair is so repetitive, all wrestler use trademark moves, but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life, for example, chop...woo...flair flop...figure four...cheat....win, that not a description of one flair match, that's every flair match. When I started watching wrestling I only saw his WWF matches, so it all looked new to me, when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are. Other wrestler have put together DVD, which shows a variety of different matches such as Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benito, Bret Hart   Shawn Michaels, all top wrestler adopt to there opponents, Flair expects his opponents to adopt to him, that's way all his matches are the same. 

The only thing worst then his DVD is his book, I lost all respect for Flair after a read his book, it seem that he is just like HHH and Shawn Michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face, put does it behind their backs. He bashes Mick Foley for being a stunt man, who only does gimmick matches, so what's HHH, a guy flair calls great, can anyone name a good HHH match that isn't a gimmick match (WM X-7 against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight). He says Foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player, who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles. He critises Bret Hart for not putting over Shawn Michaels at Survivors Series 97, when he was called upon to job to Lex Luger before he left who the WWF. he refused and took the title with him to WWF, brining the WCW to its knees. 

After watching this DVD, reading his book, and seeing how his using backstage politics at the WWE now, to keep himself in the limelight, its fair to say the Ric Flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way I could have won 16 world title if I had my friends booking the show

When this DVD came out, I got it immediately, hoping to relive my youth, but I realized something. All matches are the same, long and boring, the same moves are made again and again, and the matches only pick up speed when the opponent takes advantage. There is nothing wrong with long matches when they are well done, like the Iron Man match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, but it feels like these matches are long enough to be long enough to show flair. I also noticed that flair is so repetitive that all wrestlers use brand name moves, but Flair has used the same handful of moves all his life, for example, chop... woo... flair flop... figure four... cheat.... win that is not a description of a flair match, that is every flair match. When I started watching wrestling, I only saw his WWF fights, so everything looked new to me, when you watch his fights from back to front you realise how boring they are. Other wrestlers have put together a DVD that features a variety of different fights, including Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benito, Bret Hart Shawn Michaels, all top wrestlers who adopt their opponents. Flair expects his opponents to adopt him, so all his fights are the same. The only worst thing then his DVD is his book, I lost all respect for flair after reading his book, it seems that he just like HHH and Shawn Michaels that he did not have the balls to tell anyone something, their face, put it behind their backs. He denounces Mick Foley as a stuntman who only does gimmicks. So what HHH is, a guy who Flair calls great, anyone can call a good HHH fight that is not a gimmick match (WM X-7 against the undertaker does not count because it degenerates into a street fight). He says Foley is kissing the arse of the writers when everyone knows he is the ultimate backstage player who won 16 world titles with the Lions. He criticized Bret Hart for not overtaking Shawn Michaels on Survivors Series 97 when he was asked to take over from Lex Luger before leaving the WWF. He refused and took the title to the WWF, which brought the WCW to its knees. After watching this DVD, reading his book and seeing how he is now using backstage politics at WWE to keep himself in the spotlight, it can be said that Ric Flair is one of the most overrated wrestlers in history and I could have won 16 world titles by the way if I had let my friends book the show."

1330,"	Alec Baldwin Could've Been Hard-Boiled But Ends Up Soggy
	I remember going to great lengths to fit a matin e showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things: 

1.) The film's slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! 

2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can't be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It's too bad, because these elements could've made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named ""Alafair"" by the Robichouxs, after Dave's mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie's ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: ""I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he'd made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would've been the sexiest picture of '96!"" 

To be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there's just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they're about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin   Co. could've dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke's books instead.

	I'm not going to write too much. If you need to hear more just check other reviews down here.
From all the 3 episodes only the first one, by Kar-Wai, is worth your time. 
""The Hand"" is well done and typical Kar-Wai. Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody.
""Equilibrium"" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin.
But the worst by far is the Antonioni's episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment. The, once, great director should have just retired by now (he was 91 in 2004) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces

	After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast, Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts.  But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well?  My reasons for asking, the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie.  Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen, yet in the original film Selena, Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured.  Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school, also she looked pretty mature for thirteen.  Then there's Selen'as boyfriend (whose name escapes me at the moment) in the original film he stood by her, through the murder charges, the revelation of the rape, and the miscarriage, yet in the sequel I'm suppose to buy that he couldn't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else.  Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena, yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast?  I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door.

1333,"	Devilishly addictive, but not much payoff
	This program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.

The art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn't look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak. 

The worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the ""action"" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don't feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I. 

This first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction. Save yourself the pain.

	Director:  Turi Meyer
Cast:  Tony Todd, Donna D'Errico, Alexia Robinson, Jsu Garcia, Mark Adair-Rios, Lupe Ontiveros, Elizabeth Guber, Rena Riffel, Ernie Hudson Jr.
Running Time:  93 minutes
Rated R for bloody violence and gore, sexuality and language.

The third in the series derived from a concept by Clive Barker, ""Day of the Dead"" (they can't even come up with their own subtitle) staggers down the well-trodden path already navigated by the ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies: that is, taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet. The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish.  Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror.  Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him. 

There's not a single thing here that isn't scavenged from the first ""Candyman"" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what's supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D'Errico running around in a variety of tight vests.  The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D'Errico's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically.  Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone's stomach.  The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can't be bothered even to try something a bit different.  Clive Barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be, but he's right about one thing: the sequels to his movies are garbage

One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it's because a little fragile thing like her can't take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she'll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}.
As far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it's a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien   director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn't save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little. 
	There isn't much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that's it nothing more to it. Over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable.

1339,"	Idiotic movie about really stupid people
	Maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking, but I doubt it. Since Vanilla Ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie, the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new. I went to high school with kids like this and I've bought the Eminem CD. And there's a little more to them than the stupidity. But let's discuss the movie.

Anne Hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in East L.A. (??). Seeing her boyfriend beat down, she's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating. Then she goes to parties, gets into even more trouble and starts losing her Jerry Springer-inspired ghetto talk. The Mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner, but well he's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner. Actually, he's coming off like a gangsta Yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat. Yes, it's ironic that she's trying to dress ghetto while he's trying (not very hard) to dress suburban (wife beater is suburban?)

The movie's climax is a scene in which Anne and Bijou ask the guys if they can join their ""crew"" and if the gang didn't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked, they sure have it then (and really, who doesn't know that that's gang initiation standard - started by the Hell's Angels in 1965). After that disaster (both Anne and Bijous say no - but Bijou takes a little more time saying no) the movie unravels as Anne Hathaway discovers her inner WHITE GIRL and her friends act even more stupid. There's a neat scene between her and Bijou Philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people, but it's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie.

The one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate DJ Squalls' character from Hustle   Flow (and Hustle   Flow in and of itself) since that's a white character in a black world that doesn't fall into either extreme of wigger or Doogie Howser. He's just himself whereever he goes. He's someone the morons of this movie could learn from (but really wouldn't you rather just see them all shot dead?

Since all the characters stay together, it's easy to join in so you can switch off your brain, it's not needed. As it is about the ship, acting was not necessary. Bet films like this will herald the careers of Russell and Dreyfus? I felt sorry for them as actors and I hope they can come back to life. The film is shorter than most, so there will be minimal impact on your life. You won't remember anything soon after the unveiling"

	This movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre, far less interesting than Pulp Fiction and even below the level of Reservoir Dogs.

Despite the abundant gore if the film had been  better handled it could have been quite good. There are  glimpses of its failed potential at different  points. For instance the scene  towards the end where the prison governor's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct  copy of an actual event at the  Bastille during the days of the early French revolution. In sum, as a special kind of disgusting  art form it is interesting, as entertainment though Natural Born Killers sucks.

Red Dragon

	When I heard that Universal Studios was making a prequel to Silence of the Lambs, I'll admit that I was a little skeptical.  Throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which, more or less, is what this prequel was.  Caddyshack II, Godfather III, and Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, all horrible follow ups to great films.  So naturally I was a little worried that the film Red Dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film.  Any movie that follows a great film like Silence of the Lambs has a lot to live up to.  Personally, I thought that the first sequel to Silence of the Lambs,  Hannibal, didn't quite achieve that, and neither did Red Dragon.  It was a decent movie, but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first.  Don't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value, but since it didn't come first I had already come to expect that.  I thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films, but clearly their work shows otherwise.
	 All in all, this movie disappointed me for several reasons.  As I mentioned before, the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that I, as a fan of the films, had come to expect.  But mostly, it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors.  I've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception.

	I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment!
There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting.  
Nevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others.  It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement.  In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims....  
In short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average.  The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.  
The characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the ""fool,"" Ted Raimi, from the Xena series).
Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  
In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it. 
No masterpiece here... 2 Stars

1357,"	Zzzzzzzzzzzz
	Let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even ""boring"" to my friends.  So it isn't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me.  It isn't the unresolved ending that bothered me.  It wasn't the violence (in short bursts.)  It wasn't the acting (the acting was pretty good actually).  But as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure.  I didn't care who was sending the tapes and I didn't care what would happen with the main characters.  They were unrelatable on just about any level.  This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3/4's of the way in and you'll think, ""wow I wonder where the story will go next"".  And then it doesn't.  That was it.  Very disappointing.  I don't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there's SOME kinda payoff in the end.  I really don't understand all the acclaim that this movie got.  As a ""suspense"" movie or as an ""art"" film it fails pretty miserably.  The premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly.  Viewer beware.

	""Killing Me Softly"" has one of those scripts that just don't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation, but the big ""twist"" at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable (unless perhaps you haven't seen a thriller before in your life). The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he's an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she's not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. The ending is like when you have a 'jawbreaker' candy in your mouth, sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour. It was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did, I have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly

In spite of all that, Chen Kaige's direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous ""** out of 5"" rating. But if you're a Heather Graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes; and for Joseph Fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks.

	Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo are a New York City couple who come together after Preston leaves Matthew Broderick and Karyo uses Meg Ryan in order to get a Visa. Now Broderick and Ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex's. The problem is, the offenses they've endured (being dumped and being used) don't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people, especially Karyo. Which is probably why first-time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles. After all, how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry's Sally? Unfortunately, it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film is so uneven, and the script isn't particularly funny. 

There's a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy. Despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches, this film does not walk that line very well

The problem is that the insults they have endured (disposed of and used) do not really justify the terrible things they do to these two people, especially karyo. Which is probably why director Griffin Dunne cast two such lovable stars in the lead roles. How can we not choose Ferris Bueller and Harry's Sally? Unfortunately, it's pretty easy not to help them in the end, when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film so uneven and the script not particularly funny.

	Upon its initial release, the attention that Otto Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder"" attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems.  When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center. 
 
Attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered.  Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped.  While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature.  Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him.
 
Stewart is his dependable self in ""Anatomy of a Murder.""  In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film.  There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort.  Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay.  ""Anatomy of a Murder"" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story.  The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction.  For a film to run as long as ""Anatomy of a Murder"" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.

Im a huge Reese Witherspoon fan and I like Paul Rudd so I rented this movie and thought it would be good. Oh boy I was wrong. The charachters are over the top and the story is just cheesy. Im all for a good fun, romantic comedy. I like ""Win a date with Tad Hamilton"" but this is just awful. 

Reese plays a stripper (somehow it just doesnt work)who helps the dorky hopeless Rudd dump then win back his girlfriend. All the time there is a package to stop hence the name ""Overnight Delivery"". 

The story could have worked but it just doesnt. The premise is good and there are parts that are somewhat ammusing but overall it sucks.

I would reccomend this movie to anyone who liked the Sarah Michelle Gellar movie ""Simply Irresistable"". If you happened to like that movie with the magical little crab. If you disliked it as I did then stay away.

1370,"	How to destroy your career in one simple movie
	George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.

Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying ""Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' 

But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.

1371,"	Misses the point
	While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci ""debunking"" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this ""Rock"" of male dominancy was built the Church.

Thank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain

	During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.

It's not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that's it.  I'm sure the movie would've been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.  

Doom is the kind of movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I'm sure you don't forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite.

While the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie, I hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book. The only common thread I found were the names of the characters and the fact that Ella was cursed from birth.

I suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie, it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears, despite the fact that I've read it over 100 times

1381,"	Pretty Woman Meets Toxic Tort
	Even though I would agree that ""Erin Brockovich"" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in ""Pretty Woman.""  I am second to no one in enjoying a good ""David and Goliath"" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the ""true"" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the ""Xena"" character is the main attraction in ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).

Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in ""Pretty Woman"" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.

Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired ""work clothes"" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.

Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The ""convenience"" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar ""bonus"" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a ""thanks"" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers. 

The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.

	During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.

It's not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that's it.  I'm sure the movie would've been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.  

Doom is the kind of movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I'm sure you don't forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite.  

The Rock never should have left wrestling.  It was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans (and the Rock means MILLIONS) really miss him.  Come back home, Rock.  Please

Henry is just the kind of self-important, ego-bloated, smug, arrogant, cold-blooded corporate ass that's helped step on working people for real, so it's really hard to feel anything for him, shot or not. He's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him, and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is, if you think about it, appalling. And his wife is, in a way, even worse; she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides. She goes into a panic when she thinks they may have to give anything up, and doesn't become ""normal"" ntil much later. Only their daughter has any heart at all. Maybe a better ending would've been Henry's not making it, Bening going nuts from losing her stuff, and the kid being placed in a foster home with the kind of people her parents should've been from day one.

In fact they're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills. Once he does try to move things along, awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated set-piece to another, you can see the reason for his procrastination - despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth, he really has nothing to say. The actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film's awkward vacuousness, by giving false and short-lived impressions of character and narrative, but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything ""happen"" narrative-wise. 
2 stars is rather generous, but De Niro, Walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting, albeit for such a misguided cause.

Why not?  Because despite a few mildly surprising and utterly contrived plot twists here and there, this film is still built on a particularly toxic myth: the desperately lonely and insecure 30-something single woman who is made to be as endearingly pathetic as possible for the audience to root for her inevitable finding by a Mr. Right.  Here, the film accomplishes that by making the central character tubby, clumsy, and possessing ridiculously bad luck and ill timing.  

Almost from the first 5 minutes, this movie just reeks of focus-group-inspired audience manipulation as it slogs through the same old trite cliches and recycled TV-sitcom bits.

1402,"	Good Story Idea. Wooden Acting.
	Apparently, this is a film that many women, who have read the book, can make enjoyable. 

Characters, including Anne   the Captain, display wooden acting. Poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in ""Pride   Prejudice"" 1996   2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality. 

Both Anne   the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation, and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's   the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness to be responses of: shyness, thought, distance, hopefulness, approval, or alarm. 

You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story's ending.

This film has pretty scenery; such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often very unique and well done. There is beautiful singing in one scene, and even better, wonderful singing over the closing credits. 

Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they continued their fanciful, wishful, thoughts into rating this film. A reviewer, who liked the film, says she had read the book, and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film. A poor script for those who have not read the book. Awful directing made awful acting. 

I would like to see this good story re-made by a better Director. 

Well-made romance films are: ""Pride   Prejudice"", ""Wives   Daughters"", ""North   South"". Fairly made is ""Under the Greenwood Tree""
",0,"Good story idea. Timber. Apparently, this is a film that many women who have read the book can enjoy. Characters, including Anne, the lead, act wooden. Pokerface. Others talk at a slower pace. The quirkiness of the time enabled personality, as well shown in ""Pride Prejudice"" 1996 2006, but not here. Shyness, simplicity or slowness can be portrayed in a sympathetic way, with a certain personality. Anne, the main woman, always stays wide-eyed, desperate, constantly watching. Many of us get nervous in romance, but we are forced by conversations and activities to interrupt our nervousness by personality. Anne's constant, wide-eyed nervousness is therefore unnatural. All of us, aged Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness to be reactions: shyness, thinking, distance, hopelessness, approval or concern. One understands the quiet thoughts because of history, despite the bewildering, paralyzed looks, and not because of them. In the end, despite the wooden acting, you end up with Anne and the Captain because the story is over. This film has a beautiful landscape, like walks by the sea. The costumes are often very unique and well made."
1403,"	Fictionally Tragic
	All of us have a dark side.  Unfortunately AUTO FOCUS focuses on this small subset of actor Bob Crane's life and expands it out of proportion.  In doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of Crane's life and career as window dressing.  Even the screenplay is, at best, an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of Bob Crane and John H. Carpernter  -- since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice-accused murder suspect.

In viewing this film I knew that it would involve some of Crane's extracurricular activities.  My interest in the film was as a HOGAN'S HEROES fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six-year series.  Bob Crane's professional credits alone would make for a good film.  AUTO FOCUS unfortunately revolves around Crane's so-called ""secret life"" and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd.

Facts are facts and there are established truths about Bob Crane's private life.  AUTO FOCUS, however, should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine.  You are better off spending your time and money buying the DVD releases of the HOGAN'S HEROES television series.

	I was optimistic for Greg Kinnear once.  He was very funny ragging on Soap Soup.  He usually plays the nice-guy second banana in film or a man dying of AIDS.  Auto Focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960's TV icon, Hogan, in Hogan's Heroes.  The replication of the original cast is a bit eerie.  After all, these actors dress up as German prison guards.  A chill goes down my spine, but Hogan's was a comedy, which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny SS guys.  Anyhow, Bob Crane played Hogan for six years and Kinnear badly imitated.  Yes, I'm sorry to say, Kinnear is awful as Crane, which puts a damper on the bio-flick.

Here's a disc jockey with semi-hip 60's patter on the air with an All American family, a loving wife and cute kids.  They live like Ozzie and Harriet in the LA burbs, going to Catholic Church on Sunday.  Crane lands his big break, falling for the trappings of fame.  Most people fall for the trappings of fame.  Read the supermarket check out magazine racks.  So all of a sudden, Crane's garage porn collection isn't enough.  Women, very beautiful, Hollywood loose-morals women find Crane and his buddy William Defoe irresistible.  The birth of the video camera comes into play.

The trouble with the script or maybe it's the cardboard way Kinnear acts, we watch, but in the end, we don't care.

	I just watched this movie version of the classic childrens' book with my wife.  Here are my gut impressions:

First, very little is true to the book.  That's not really a gut impression.  That's the impression I got hearing my wife say ""That's not in the book...that's not in the book...""

Actually this movie is more like a computer animation demo than a vehicle for story telling.  It makes for beautiful stills and pictures, and those made me want to see the movie.   

I expected a heart warming Christmas story, and what I got was about an hour of frantic scenes of out-of-control railroad and other technology animated like never before with just enough pauses betwen them to remind me why I'm watching.  You get to see...
 
A kid chasing a ticket through a train,
 
A kid chasing a ticket over the roof of a train,
 
A ticket making its way through the forest -- Rube Goldberg style -- back to the train,

(Forty minutes into this movie and one girl's train ticket is the star of the show!)

OK, the ticket sub plot is resolved and we have...

A train sliding out of control on the ice,

A train trying to outrun cracks on the ice,

A train going full throttle out of control and racing up and down mountain valleys like a roller coaster (fans of the ""coaster tycoon"" series of computer games will feel right at home) until finally it arrives at the North Pole. 

Then, the train car with the central character kids gets detached so we have...

A train car running out of control through Santa's village,

Kids getting lost in the Christmas present manufacturing plant and falling through the chutes and machinery of the factory, and then...

Kids getting lost in a bag of presents that is taken by a flying machine to Santa's sled launching pad where the star at the top of the tree is dislodged and nearly impales an innocent elf.  Ho ho ho.

At least let me have a joystick and a couple of buttons so I can help these kids out!  It's like a computer animated train wreck in fast motion.  You know it's awful but you can't look away!  

And, you'd better think twice before letting any very young children see this.  It could be very frightening on a big screen with the volume turned up.  My wife and I were going to watch it with our three and six year old sons, and we were very glad that we didn't.

So, what could have been a classic, enduring, and endearing compliment to a classic childrens' Christmas story is little more than a great line for some computer animator to have on his or her resume.  Two thirds of this movie is devoted to stuff that doesn't advance the story or develop the characters one bit.  Whatever a ""character driven"" story is, this is the opposite.  Never have I seen so many rendered pixels doing so much and accomplishing so little.

I'd rather set up my old American Flyer electric trains and let them run around the tree while I read the book to my kids.

	The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times.  So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant.   What a disappointment!  The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy.  There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?)  who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as ""Do you believe in Ghosts?""  The ""lighter"" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling.  Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D.  Yet ""The Polar Express"" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.

1408,"	A Detriment to the Environmental Movement
	This film is a tough one to review. The film itself is amazing. So therefore, I should give it high marks. The problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos, and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature (as if we came from outer space or something). That is a bad and dangerous message, and so I feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that.

Amazing footage, but ultimately does nothing but further the sensationalism required to seek and destroy more animals and natural habitats. How many grizzlies are hunted down and killed every year vs. how many humans are killed by grizzlies every year? Then take into account the fish we killed off because of dams, pollution, and over fishing that destroy the bears food source.

How many grizzlies kill humans vs. how many cars kill humans? Shouldn't we all be more scared of cars?

I agree with the other reviewers that have said that this guy is cracked and self-serving. We can co-exist with nature, but not in the way this nutjob tries to do it. Native Americans (whom we also destroyed) co-existed with them for thousands of years. They respected the grizzly. This guy no more respects the grizzly than does the cancerous civilization he condemns.

Treadwell was very conflicted and troubled. Not that we aren't all troubled, not that we all don't deal with failure and disappointment, not that a good rant doesn't make you feel better from time to time, but he had a death wish, and this was really just suicide by bear the way I saw it. Am I the only one that noticed he seemed very at odds with his sexuality? Lastly, in some of the interviews, well, they were just weird and contrived, like they were acting.

1410,"	I'll be there... but not for long
	There's a reason why they talk about the ""Voice of an Angel"" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one. Her acting debut ""I'll Be There"" is proof enough -- only the presence of its star got this tepid little drama into theatres, where it rapidly dropped out of sight. Rightly so.

Seventeen years ago, Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) of the Love Rats had a fling with a groupie at a concert. Fast forward to the present: Kerr discovers that unknown to him, his ex Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave) gave birth to a daughter, Olivia (Charlotte Church), who is now a well-adjusted paper girl.

The problem is, Olivia has been kept a secret from her dad. Rebecca is embittered, but Kerr wants to get to know his daughter, and similarly Olivia wants to get to know her father. Music seems to be the thing that will bring the angel-voiced girl and the burned-out rocker together, but Rebecca doesn't want her child to follow in her father's footsteps.

""I'll Be There"" was hyped months in advance as being inspired by the life of actress Liv Tyler, who, despite being only in her twenties, has had an immensely interesting life. Well, maybe someday she WILL get a biopic, because ""I'll Be There"" is only similar in one way: It involves a rock star and his daughter. Otherwise, it is boring in about every way that Tyler's life is interesting.

With a forgettable script, not much humor and a goofy premise, the movie doesn't have a lot going for it -- it reads like a disgruntled teenager's absurdist fantasy, scripted for Church to act out. And not a terribly interesting teenager, either. It gets increasingly ridiculous when Olivia decides to pursue music to bond with Daddy Dearest; it's an obvious ploy to show off Church's vocal skills. 

The best that can be said of Church's performance is that at times she looks sweet. As for acting talent, she is bland at best, but she does perform some good songs, and her voice is as pretty as ever. Just watch the songs and fast-forward her actual scenes. Redgrave does as good a job as she can, and Ferguson wrings some pathos from his performance as an aging rocker. His is the only memorable role in the film, and it's a shame that the movie didn't focus on him rather than the dull Miss Church.

Miss Church appears to have chosen a role that glorifies her in the middle of an atrocious film -- also known as the Britney Spears approach. ""I'll Be There,"" but I promise I'll get out as soon as I can

	This was probably the worst Royal Rumble in history. It featured three very bad matches, one decent one, a lousy Royal Rumble and an absolutely amazing match.

Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show, Royal Rumble Qualifier
This match was absolutely awful. The Big Show is a decent wrestler, but Brock Lesnar is absolutely terrible. A predictable ending made this match all the worse. This match is like watching a tumble weed.

The Dudley Boys (C) vs. William Regal and Lance Storm
This was a fairly decent match. Regal and Storm are very good wrestlers and in the tag team forum, the Dudleys can hold their own. Its sad though that this was the second best match on the card. Nice surprise ending though.

Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie
If you take out the fact that Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie are very nice to look at, this match is worthless. Unless you are really bored dont even bother watching this.

Triple H (C) vs. Scott Steiner
Triple H did all he could to save this one, but Steiner really cant wrestle anymore. I remember back in the early 90s where Scott Steiner was one of the best wrestlers in the game. Now he can hardly even move. This match really isnt worth seeing, yet its still better than some of the other matches on the card.

Kurt Angle (C) vs. Chris Benoit
There is no way to fairly describe this match. It was outstanding, phenomenal, amazing, incredible, brilliant. These two guys know how to wrestle and they put on a clinic. This match is easily one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time, and shows that you dont need steroids and steel chairs to put on an amazing match. Angle and Benoit are the two best wrestlers in the business and this match is proof.

2003 Royal Rumble Match
This match was decent alright. There werent any really good spots. It was fairly boring all the way through, and highly predictable. It got a little interesting when the final five were in, Rob Van Dam, Kane, Undertaker, Batista and Lesnar. Unfortunately, Lesnar is an awful wrestler and he looked pathetic out there with other talented wrestlers. A guy like Brock should never be in the Royal Rumble. It's sad when the worst wrestler by far in the match wins.


Its sad that an event with one of the greatest matches of all time gets only a 2 out of 5 rating, but theres nothing much to watch here other than Benoit/Angle. As I said, the Rumble was poor, the undercard was weak, and several of the matches were downright awful. The Benoit DVD has the Angle/Benoit match. Buy that. This isnt worth your money

1413,"	Racist Jokes Unfunny
	Let's face it; some of the jokes are funny. The one about Mike Tyson been like someone else's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny. I also found the bit about Bill Clinton and Osama Bin Laden also funny. However, Jamie dwells too much on the fart joke. How can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes? After 2 min it becomes worn and so ""unfunny"". Why does he repeat himself so much with that line, ""I am not saying she's a crackhead, just a bit crackish""? It sounds very rehearsed after the second time. If it were only for these errors I would have found the jokes altogether acceptable.

What I found completely unacceptable were the racist jokes that he made against Arabs. I am black myself but found some of the jokes about Islam and Arabs to be in bad taste. Jamie could not even get an Arab accent right. C'mon, guys the accent Jamie pulled was an Indian accent and not an Arab accent.

I kept asking myself, ""what would black people do if a white comedian (say Robin Williams) makes the same crude jokes about black people?"" Would it be acceptable?"". I think not. I am sure the black press would slaughter Robin if he did. I wish to call a spade a spade. Nonsensical, crude racist jobs against any ethnic group (black, white, Asian and yes Arabs) are not funny. They degrade and demean. For not even managing to get an Arabic accent, Jamie deserves 2 stars from me.

There is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion, this requires the sacrifice of a dove. Two little girls watch. Years later they're grown up. One leaves to live with her boyfriend. But the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck (never stand in the middle of a road). We see scenes where the neighbor kids yell ""witch"", as if to symbolize something.

Sally goes when Jillian calls her; she has a problem with her boyfriend. But Sally uses a ""magic potion"" to eliminate the problem. Now Jillian wants to undo what was done. [The film began to lose me now, it wasn't funny.] The spell goes awry, they bury their mistake. Then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles. Later an investigator comes around looking for Jimmy. [The story drags again.] More scenes follow; they are not funny or scary or even entertaining. But a scene in the attic will wake you even if you're snoozing! They call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of Jillian. It seems to work, even if they don't use the standard issue witches broom. There is a sort of happy ending.

Sandra and Nicole are good actresses, but they can't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies I've ever seen. ""Bell, Book, and Candle"" is a funnier film, ""Blair Witch"" is a scarier film. This falls between the cracks.

1438,"	Some Laughs, But No Real Heart--""Just Friends"" Just Doesn't Cut It
	Comedy comes in many forms--everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire--and in ""Just Friends"" there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types.  First, the movie wants to be a gross-out comedy.  The sight gags are plentiful, the physical comedy abundant and often cruel, and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic.  However, the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy--the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart.  These elements have been combined successfully in the past--""There's Something About Mary"" jumps right to mind.  Here, we get something far less successful.

First, the good news.  There are legitimate laughs to be had in ""Just Friends"" and that was a pleasant surprise.  If you don't care about character development and just want inane humor, you could do worse than this movie.  And if the sight of Ryan Reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you--check this out right away.

Sadly, it's the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite.  There is nothing real at stake here to care about--and the blame for this falls squarely on Reynolds' character (I'll use the word character lightly here).  Reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working--the problem, however, is that he's not in sitcoms anymore.  He's making movies, unfortunately--and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character.  Here, he plays a celebrity insider--a successful, trendy record executive.  And yet, he's not believable as trendy, successful or professional.  His character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero, you never know or understand him--he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag.

It's too bad, really, because Amy Smart--as his love interest--IS playing a character.  I'm not usually a fan, but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down.  But it's Anna Faris that I'm going to single out for the most inspired performance.  The funniest bits to me revolve around her character--a shallow, insane pop star.  Sure, it's an easy target--but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious, over-the-top gusto that she is easily a cast standout.

Again, some humor--no emotion.  If you don't expect much from your comedy, you might just like this.  The fatal flaw for me is that I felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship, but didn't do anything to make it REAL.

	I bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises. I love Karen Voight but this dvd was definately the worst I have yet to purchase of hers. All the other Karen Voight I own I absolutely love

1442,"	Disgusting.
	I think this film wants to make you vomit. I don't know about you, but that is not a quality I am looking for in my films. Being scared is fine; being in suspense is great, vomiting is not. I really think that is what this film was going for. It has some pretty disgusting moments. While I was watching it I kept feeling this retching feeling at the back of my throat during certain scenes. In fact, I am feeling it now as I write this review and think about the movie.

The story runs like this: A meteor falls to earth. It has an alien life in it which shoots into people and uses them as an incubation device. This of course means then when the aliens decide to hatch out of incubation...well its not a pretty picture as you may imagine. In the meantime the people who have aliens incubating inside them turn into rotting-corpse looking creatures, or in the case of the head alien, just a big pile of disgustingness.

The idea itself isn't a bad one, and its executed in a relatively skillful way. In fact, the idea is much more original than many other horror movies. But as I said before, it's just too disgusting to be really enjoyable. This movie was confused as to whether it wanted to be a comedy or a horror and while it was trying to figure that out it failed in both categories

1444,"	Bad Quality DVD
	The video in this DVD looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a DVD disc. A standard 4.7GB disc, by the way; that's what you'll get when you buy this.

I say this because I've used those programs before and know how they alter the video. This is how they alter it, and how it looks on this USA release of the DVD:

Skin color is too red. Dark (shadowed) areas are greenish. White/beige is pinkish. Grey is bluish. White has blue on it. The colors are just totally messed up.

Evidence of grey being blue = look at Robert Duvall's uniform (you'll see him 3 minutes into the movie). The german uniform is a semi-light grey. It is too dark and filled with blue.

Then look behind him at the wall. A lovely dark shadow of green.

Evidence of white/beige being pinkish, when Robert Duvall walks into that office, look at the walls. They should be a kind of white/beige color but they are not a shade of white at all, they are pinkish.

As he walks into the office to sit down, you see curtains on the wall in the office. They are supposed to be white, but they're filled with blue.

At 48 minutes into the movie, you see Donald Sutherland sitting in the grass with the character Molly. His suit is supposed to be black. Look at it. It's purple. That is not black.

On top of all that, the movie is too dark. There should have been a brightness/contrast adjustment. If you pay attention to dark areas in the movie, such as fixtures around a room or an office, most times, they are pitch black and indistinguished. For example, look at desk drawers, telephones, vases, black hair, black jackets..even Robert Duvall's eye patch. Not much shading, usually pitch black.

I've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the North American release.

I plan to get the Region 2 (Europe) release. I'd rather do without watching it on my TV and watch it on my computer in better, ""proper"" quality.

'Nuff said

1446,"	Very light on baby care basics
	This newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like ""pre-birth preparation,"" which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a ""ultimate baby care DVD.""

The DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says ""over an hour of hints""... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of ""you should always consult your doctor"" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.

I've seen this DVD and the ""ABC of Newborn Baby Care"" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.

Another thing that I wasn't really impressed with was the camera was at times only focusing on Kristi Dear's face or the animated bear and it was hard for me and our girls to follow exactly what moves she was doing when.  We had to run through the DVD a second time to really get the routine.  The total time of the DVD is 30 minutes, but only about 20-22 minutes of that is actual warm-up or workout time.  The rest is filler about why we need to exercise and eat healthy foods and snacks, which is fine to watch for the first time or two, but then I found myself fast forwarding through it to get to the workout sections.  Which if I had to do that every single time I watched it with my girls, I would get annoyed really fast.  My husband really did not think it was worth 16 dollars, he'd be willing to spend maybe 5-7 dollars on it, but no more.

    I gave the DVD 2 stars because Kristi Dear really does a good job of communicating with kids, has a pleasant voice, and demonstrates easy moves and routines for kids to do.  I highly recommend that you rent this first to see what you really think about it.

	The Hidden Fortress is classic Kurosawa, in every way--except for the wild overacting, inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film.  Had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued, or given comic material with more edge, skewering the upper classes as well as themselves, or been less in the focus and operated far in the background, this wouldn't have been a problem.  But instead we're offered a sort of Dumb   Dumber, Beavis   Butthead of Japan, 50 years ago.  (And yes, I know that is anachronistic, but it's all too true.)  ""Stupidity is funny"" wears thin after a short while, and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast.  Oh, here comes a rocky upwards incline: let's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up, etc.

Which is all too bad, because while the rest of the film has its overblown heroics, its far from bad.  The interactions between cast members has both tension and grit, while the outdoor settings mark a difference from the usual run of Japanese period films (though Kurosawa addicts like myself will well recall what he could do in Roshomon).  Mifune is over the top but splendid, and the direction has energy and focus.

I've seen this film twice in 25 years; most recently, just last night, again.  Unfortunately, my initial impressions were only confirmed--and I wish they weren't

	The first Butterfly Effect is one of my all-time favorite movies. With that in mind, I eagerly started watching BE2. Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.

There is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it's too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.

The writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.

The first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.

	Instructions: rent Steven Seagall's latest action movie knuckle-fest ""Exit Wounds"". Insert in DVD player; watch first 15 minutes of movie, remove from DVD player. Return to video store. 


If you follow those instructions to the letter, you'll have fun with ""Exit Wounds"", which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory (Seagall attempts to thwart a brash, brazen assassination attempt). 

There's also a great scene---strike that, a Priceless Scene: hipster uber-villain (played convincingly by rapper DMX) and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot (ultimately settling on a Lamborghini Murcielago, paid for in cash out of a golf bag).

The scene is dope, def, and cool---it's all GOOD, Dawgz!----,in a New Jack City way. And that's a shame, really: it's so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin, over the course of two hours, to realize that the rest of the movie just can't hold a candle to its opening minutes. 

An action movie should be exciting; after Seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the U.S. Vice President (a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own, and from which 95% of the trailer material was taken), ""Exit Wounds"" is not exciting. 

It's stale. It's rehashed. Honestly, were it not for DMX, the few riffs from the movie's excellent rap soundtrack, and the equipment, I would have thought I was watching an eighties Seagall flick. And that's surprising, given that the movie is helmed by ""Romeo Must Die"" director Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also did the cinematography for Speed, Lethal Weapon 4, and Devil's Advocate. 

The plot, what there is of it, deals with police corruption, and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and doesn't make any sense---but by that time you've stopped caring. You've seen all of this before---done better.

Worst of all, Seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero; he's reached that wheezing, shortness of breath stage that afflicted Roger Moore back in ""View to a Kill""---except Seagall doesn't have the acting chops that Moore was able to fall back on. Tom Arnold is thrown in for laughs, but the laughs are so feeble, and the jokes so stale, that you're laughing *at* Arnold and Seagall---not with them. 

Midway through ""Exit Wounds"" I was fighting to stay awake, and that's a shame, given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer, hectic energy than any movie I've seen since ""Face/Off"". 

Rent the DVD for that opener if you dare, but if you stay any longer you'll see it's true: Old Action Heroes never die, they just fade away.

",0,"Old action heroes don't die, they just fade away. Instructions: Rent Steven Seagall's latest action film, ""Exit Wounds."" Insert into the DVD player; watch the first 15 minutes of the movie, remove from the DVD player. Back to the video library. If you follow these instructions to the last, you'll have fun with ""Exit Wounds,"" which features one of the best opening sequences of any recent action movie (Seagall tries to thwart a brazen, brazen assassination attempt). There's also a great scene that's priceless: hipster Uber villain (convincingly played by rapper DMX) and a henchman go shopping in an exotic car country (and eventually settle on a Lamborghini Murcielago, which they pay in cash from a golf bag). The scene is dope, def and cool - it's all GOOD, Dawgz! -, in New Jack City style. And that's a real shame: it's so cool that you just grit your teeth when you start to realize in the course of two hours that the rest of the film just can't hold a candle in the opening minutes. An action movie should be thrilling; after Seagall foiled a neatly organized assassination attempt on the US Vice President (a brilliant little sequence that alone deserves a star and from which 95% of the trailer material comes), ""Exit Wounds"" is not exciting. It's old-fashioned. It's reheated. Honestly, without DMX, the few riffs from the excellent rap soundtrack of the movie and the equipment, I would have thought I'd see a Seagall movie from the eighties. And that's surprising, as the film is being directed by ""Romeo Must Die"" director Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also took on the camera work for Speed, Lethal Weapon 4 and Devil's Advocate. The plot, which is about police corruption, has a big twist towards the end that takes the narrative out of context and doesn't make sense - but at this point you don't care. All this has been seen better before. Worst of all, Seagall is simply too old to be a credible action hero; he has reached the panting, breathlessness-inducing phase that befell Roger Moore in ""View to a Kill"" - except that Seagall does not have the acting chops Moore could fall back on."

1473,"	Five Years Later, Still Not Happy with Disney's Release Policies
	As I write this review, it was 5 years ago this very day that the Walt Disney Co. released the classic ""Fantasia"" for the first time on DVD as a 60th Anniversary Special Edition.  But exactly 5 years later, you can no longer purchase a legitimate, new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price, via such avenues as ebay.

As a Disney shareholder, I am one unhappy camper!!

This is the only reason I'm rating this classic 5-star film with only 2 stars.  The DVD is no longer legitimately available without forking over at least $40 or $50 for a new copy when the original list price was well under $30 (and that current price is only going to go up as times passes by).  I'm sure I'm not the only consumer that's really sick and tired of Disney's inane policy of releasing and then quickly yanking some of their DVD releases.

So what am I supposed to do now?  Wait another 5 to 10 years just to buy a legitimate copy of this DVD when Disney finally decides that the time is right to release it again?  I think not!  I can't wait that long, and my nieces and nephews will probably be too old to care at that point.  Or, should I instead pay an insane price now for an original copy (the profits of which WILL NOT go to Disney)?  Again, I don't think so!  I do not believe in getting ripped off, and refuse to support those that profit from it, regardless of supply/demand fundamentals.

If Disney insists on continuing their ridiculous and outdated practice of discontinuing some of their classic films on DVD after only 2 to 3 years of availability, it shouldn't surprise them at all that they're actually LOSING POTENTIAL SALES to counterfeit/pirated versions of the films that are being sold around the world (and from auction sites like ebay, too).  The way I see it, THEY ASKED FOR IT!!  By not making these classics legitimately available at all times, they are encouraging piracy.  It's that simple, and they deserve it!!  In this day and age, people are not going to wait a few years to get something they want NOW!!

I guess Disney is forcing me to think about buying a phony yet much cheaper DVD version of the original ""Fantasia"" just so I can show this classic to my nieces and nephews.  I'd much rather buy a legitimate copy that's reasonably priced, but I can't because Disney won't allow me to do so.  Oh well, it's their loss.  A classic film like ""Fantasia"", which came in at No. 58 on the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 100 greatest American movies of all time, deserves a far better fate than this. 

Great job Disney!!  Way to go!

1476,"	""I must know everything.  I must penetrate the heart of his secret!  I must become Caligari!""
	Robert Wiene's ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is a celebrated work of German Expressionism.  While there are several interesting facets to it, this grand experiment in filmmaking cannot be regarded as a complete success.

Francis (Friedrich Feher) relays a strange story.  A man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) once came to his town seeking a permit to display an exhibit at a carnival.  The exhibit was a wooden cabinet that housed a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  Strange happenings then ensued after Cesare predicted the death of one of Francis's friends.  Concerned for the safety of his beloved Jane (Lil Dagover), Francis took it upon himself to determine whether Caligari was the person responsible for the disturbing series of events.

In a strange way, one can look upon ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" as a bizarre version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939).  The framing sequences are similar and the surreal appearance of the town effectively creates an unfamiliar world that has its own unique and distinct visual identity.  Yet, despite the ample creativity on display and the intriguing ideas the film explores in regards to memory and interpretation, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is stiff and dreary.  The characters are not engaging and the story is just a generic murder mystery with a monster thrown in.  Give ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" points for trying to do something different and for influencing the look and feel of horror films that followed, but feel free to skip it if you are not a fan of the peculiar.

1488,"	BORING   very un-natural (almost fake)
	This program was BORING! As much as Billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated, about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were, and of course my kids at home, and I'm sure any other kid picked up on this, and soon lost interest.
Several things made this program boring:
One, you can't understand a thing Billy is saying, he would mumble unclear phrases thoughout the entire program, and his demeanor was very un-natural, to the point of being fake. He just looked   sounded very out of place working with kids. It came across like he   his crew weren't really sure how to interact with the kids, making them appear to be very fake. Another boring point was the movements, there was absolutely NO creativity here, these were some of the EXACT same movements from the adult Tae-Bo videos. Now, I do applaud Billy for slowing the movements down (unlike the adult Tae-Bo which goes at a break neck pace), these movements are performed in a controlled manner. But, they are still adult type movements, and extremely boring for kids. I would have liked to have seen some creativity with these movements to make them more kid friendly, and more EXCITING!
To be honest my kids were turned off   bored with this program after the first 10 minutes. Something Billy needs to realize is, kids are smarter than people give them credit for being. - They can tell when someone is being fake   not truly having fun, and they also realize that when kids on T.V. are bored   not having fun, then this isn't something they want to do. Kids want to have fun, and want to watch the instructor   other kids having fun. That is how you motivate children

	Each scene is one shot, and that shot goes on and on and on, sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action.  This film is pretension personified, but that's okay.  Many people can't tell the difference between pretension and art.  The music too is full of squeaks and squawks.  In case you didn't know, that means that the music too is high art.  

There is no story.  Boy and girl see each other, and without preliminaries hit the sack.  We see boy   girl here, there, in the sack, here, there, in the sack, etc.  Occasionally we get a shot of some of the other characters.  

Because of the lack of dynamics, the film is not effective, either as drama or as eroticism.  Ironically, ""The Summer of '42"" was much more erotic even without any nudity (which would have helped).  

The vaulted sex scenes are three in number, chest and shoulders, and they last about three minutes each.  The much-touted fellatio scene is actually surprisingly good, more convincing than the ""love"" scenes.  

There are also a few brief full-frontal scenes of the star, who has a gorgeous body (hence, the two star rating).  

Bottom line: the only reason to see this movie is the nudity and the sex.  But there are many better movies for that.  So, only if you need the pretentiousness in order to permit yourself to see a sex movie should you see this.

I cannot believe people, excuse me, some women are giving this movie four and five stars. 
Interesting premise,and it could have been a good, believeable movie-- but it was sooo syrupy. If this is what it's like to be in love, please somebody shoot me(note: I've been in real love for 27 years now.) I got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end. Why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a ""good movie""?
I felt like I was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over. Wouldn't it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out? That, at least, would have made the movie more intriquing, believeable and redeeming. If ever a movie was made to force tears, this is it. 
This movie stinks and I don't mind telling you so--and it's not just because I'm a man either. Imo, there's not much difference between this movie and a stupid, blatant Steven Segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it's the elixir of heaven. Same coin, different sides.
  The movie should be given a ""one""--no a ""negative one"" just for the stupid ending, but other redeeming factors make it a ""two."" Still not worth seeing--i.e., unless you're into infuriating yourself.

**  Note: Even my wife and daughter--both chick-flick connousiours--hate this movie.I haven't checked yet, but I think my dogs do too.**

1498,"	Too dumb to be funny
	""Legal Eagles"" is supposed to be a comedy. We're supposed to find the characters played by Robert Redford and Debra Winger to be amusing, their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious, and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying.

The problem is that the movie is too dumb to be taken seriously, and thus too dumb to be funny.

Briefly, the story takes place in New York. Robert Redford is an assistant District Attorney about to be promoted to be the DA. Debra Winger is a defense attorney, and Daryl Hannah is a young woman with emotional problems, and is Debra Winger's client. The plot involves a fire 20 years ago, when Daryl Hannah was eight, a fire that killed her artist father and purportedly destroyed a large number of his paintings. This experience left Daryl Hannah traumatized, but all is not as it seems, and now, 20 years later, Daryl Hannah is first accused of attempted theft and later of murder.

Unfortunately, the plot involves many elements that simply don't make sense. I won't go into detail, but Roger Ebert does a good job of listing four different major things that make the plot completely unbelievable.

As well as the story being dumb I found some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny to be anything but. 

For example, Robert Redford is a weekend father to a teenage daughter. At one point his ex-wife threatens to go to court to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Robert Redford makes a telephone call to his ex-wife's home and starts an angry monologue of threats about how he'll take her apart in court. Then he realizes that he's actually talking to his daughter! This mistake is apparently supposed to be hilarious. Ha, ha.

In another scene Robert Redford and Debra Winger are together and see one of the bad guys. Robert Redford takes off on foot to try to catch him. Debra Winger, who doesn't know how to drive a car, feels it necessary for her to jump into Robert Redford's car and try to follow him. She makes a wrong turn and finds herself going the wrong way into traffic on a wide heavily trafficked street. There follows one minute of her frantically dodging cars at the last moment. Very funny. Ha, ha, ha.

This movie could have been a fairly good romantic thriller if they had fixed the plot and not tried to be a comedy. But the dumb plot and the unfunny attempts at comedy make it a complete waste of time.

But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn't force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It's not a good adventure film, and it's certainly not erotic.

There's a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust.

1503,"	The novel would be better
	Harold Ramis's ""The Ice Harvest"" wallows in mid-market crime and holiday angst, but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires.  All the ingredients are there, but ultimately the movie lacks spice.  In some movies, it works where all the characters move at a slow pace - ""Nobody's Fool,"" for example.  But a dark comedy needs some pep, and ""The Ice Harvest"" doesn't have it.

A lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors.  He is at his best when he is riffing one of his intelligent-yet-soulful monologues, like in ""High Fidelity"" and ""Say Anything.""  Here, Cusack's job is to look morose and make the occasional comment - he may speak the fewest lines in any film he's made as a leading man, and that's a shame.  Billy Bob Thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes, but the menacing actor is off-screen for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt.  The same with the entertaining Oliver Platt, who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone - he's enjoyable on-screen, but when he's not there, we miss him.

The bar is set pretty high for holiday-as-setting-for-dysfunction movies. None of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the husband-wife spat of ""The Ref,"" for example.  The movie is filled with small-time hoods who all seem hung-over or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits.  Instead, we get an ominous film that in many ways tries to evoke ""Fargo"" or ""A Simple Plan,"" but doesn't get anywhere close.  

There are a few laugh-out-loud moments that I won't spoil that keep the movie from being a complete waste of time.  But all in all, the movie is a downer, and when the winners are finally revealed at the end, it feels less like a triumph than it does a ho-hum conclusion.  

Throughout the movie, I kept wondering if this would have been a much more enjoyable movie where we got to see what was actually going on inside the minds of the characters . . . there seemed to be many scenes where the actors kept the best lines to themselves.  Petty crime can be highly enjoyable, but not in ""The Ice Harvest.""

The same goes for the entertaining Oliver Platt, who plays a drunken idiot just like everyone else - he's fun on screen but when he's not there we miss him. The bar for films that serve as backdrops for dysfunction is quite high. None of the exchanges reach the heights of emotion that the spousal spat of ""The Ref,"" for example, reaches.

1504,"	Wow.  I don't care...
	Long, tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog, bad plot holes, and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from Bad Boys.  

Marcus and Mike are out about, trying to find some ecstasy they've been alerted about.  They get into a bunch of fights, a bunch of car chases, they get in trouble, they argue with each other.  Then they go and they get into another fight, then they get in trouble, only this time they argue with each other first.  Then they argue with each other, then get into a fight, then get in trouble.  Then they get into trouble, argue with each other, and get into a fight.  The fights?  The same thing, over and over again.  Marcus is upset because he feels his life is in danger.  Mike is upset because he feels Marcus is bringing in negative energy.  They parody relationship therapy.

There's another thing happening.  It's this Cuban antagonist.  We don't really care about him, really.  He just kind of runs around, being Cuban and evil and all.  Then we get to see him get angry at people.  Then he becomes devious.  Then he becomes malicious and angry again.

So we watch, for over two hours, with just enough action to keep it moving.  Action that involves a certain camera movement, then a reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot...  The only truly interesting action scene occurred in that house with the Rastafarians, with that spinning camera thing.  That was pretty clever.  That's why this film got any stars at all from me.

Really, all I got from this film was the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make the Bad Boys series, if there will ever be one (probably...) into the Lethal Weapon series.  I also got a lot of stuff about terrible psychoanalysis which was, to me, Michael Bay telling the world that male attraction to action adventure movies is not some weird psychoanalitical crazy mess, but just good natured fun.  Which is why the movie got a bit more of a higher rating from me.

Otherwise, wow, was that tedious.

",0,"Wow. I don't care... Long, boring action adventure with repetitive dialogue, bad plot holes and generally boring characters is how you describe this little trip to follow the characters from Bad Boys. Marcus and Mike are out and about trying to find some ecstasy they were warned about. They get into a series of fights, chases, they get into trouble, they argue with each other. Then they go and get into another fight, then they get into trouble, only this time they argue with each other first. Then they argue with each other, then get into an argument, then get into trouble. Then they get into trouble, argue and get into an argument. The fighting? The same thing, over and over again. Marcus is upset because he sees his life in danger. Mike is upset because he feels Marcus is bringing negative energy. They parody relationship therapy. Something else is happening. It's this Cuban antagonist. We don't really care. He just walks around, is Cuban and evil and everything."

	After 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please.

	This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking ""Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?"" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!

1509,"	How to destroy your career in one simple movie
	George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.

Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying ""Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' 

But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.

1511,"	REINVENTING THE WHEEL
	The flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.  I quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf Astoria downtown.

""I have to admit that I didn't you who you were until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS.  I don't mean to embarrass you; but that book changed my life.""

I tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment.  For the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile.  I very much approved of her legs.

As I departed the car, Kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes.

""Don't forget.  I'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together.  Please be ready.""

I expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp.  The hotel staff greeted me and soon I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor.  As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours.

Finally, a bit of peace.  I poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below.  For a few moments I contemplated the remarks I was to make at this evening's formal ceremonies, then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room.  

I turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit.

""Well, Crabby, aren't you glad to see me?""

Before I could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right.  It was Jennifer Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit.

""Sweetheart, don't look at her.  Come here to me.""

""Get out!"" screamed Sandy.  

""No, you get out.  It's not fair.  I left Brad for him so I get him!""

The two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment.  Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other.  It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain, and nylon tearing could be heard.  Then almost a quickly as it began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor.  

Sandy marched back into the room victorious.  I ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked.  Before I could think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder.  I turned around and there Sandy stood.  A little worse for wear.  Trying to catch her breath.  Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet.

""Forget her.  She won't bother us now.""

Sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume.  She posed standing and anticipating my admiration.  

""Now I'm all sweaty and warm.  I need a shower.""  Sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond.

I turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor.  Then I heard Sandy calling.

""Crabby, why don't you come and help me?  You could soap up my......""


OOPS!!!!  Sorry!!!  Err...just a little fantasy of mine.  I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over.  I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here.  You see, the cover of this DVD displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font letters.  But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love interest.

As much as I ""love"" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her.  Her best films have been WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS.  Unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON, HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie.

The plot revolves around two ""losers in love"" who are unappealing both in looks and personality.  Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet.  All goes well until others find out their secret and Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other.

The story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet.  Chances are you can find a copy of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you can really do something worth wild.

After listening to the characters for ninety minutes, I finally came to the conclusion that many of the characters sounded alike and the one connection point was Mamet. Real people talk differently from each other. They use different and distinct speech patterns and phrases and slang. I've had this problem with Mamet before and I can't believe nobody has ever noticed this before - and I would doubt that I am the first. I wouldn't be surprised if - somewhere - some actor in some Mamet production has pondered this before. Come on! Good dialogue is like good acting: if it's really good, you don't notice it until the show's over.

	Don't expect a comedy in the vein of TRINITY or THEY CALL ME TRINITY. If you do, you are in for a fall. Both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining. This one has no such pretensions. It is merely boring.

The story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town's folk out of their claims. They do this through intimidation and violence.

To do this, they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction. They yell, they fight, they wrestle, they shoot and then they do it some more. Its not very exciting cinema.

This production is made worse by the DVD. I suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair. The DVD, however, is of such low quality that who could really tell? The edges are clipped off, the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it. IT was not worth the effort.

The edges are cropped, the transmission is grainy and the effect is that someone holds a hidden cellphone camera in a theater to bootleg it. IT wasn't worth it."

	If this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. There just wasn't time enough, I guess, to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book

1528,"	Sorry, But Disco (and 54) Were Actually FUN!
	I guess when any era becomes old enough for the ""Nostaglia Craze"" to hit, we get to see what exagerations get stretched to the point of lying. Case in point the 1950's were NOT such an innocent age, and the 1970's were NOT that wild.

Studio 54, and the Disco Era in general were about Freedom, Great Music, Great People Watching, and in general having a hell of a goodtime. For the brief period that it ruled the music charts, Disco broke down barriers, and the stars of certain musical genres were able to crossover. I often call 1979 ""the year that music got close to the light"".

My BIG issue with this movie is that It FAILED to show that for many of us we took advantage of the liberation of Disco's (like 54), and ENJOYED ourselves. It was glamorous, it was over the top, and IT WAS FUN. Amazing as it seems, many of us did not inhail cocaine like air, and for some of us who did indulge, we did not become adicts, or for that matter guilt ladden.

Clubs like Studio 54 were great palaces that broke down many barriers, and helped us escape the many issues facing the nation in the late 70's.

	I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.

A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?

I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.

1532,"	A watery, passive, poorly cast, revisionist production
	Filming the story of Gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio, from Warner Brothers to BBC. The Virgin Queen still retains her power to enthrall, intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne. She was perhaps England's last true absolute monarch, and certainly one of its greatest, if not most famous. 

Since the advent of film, she has been one of the most coveted roles to play. Indeed, few monarchs have been so closely chronicled, save perhaps her own father, Henry VIII, and Victoria. 

She has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses: Sarah Bernhardt, Bette Davis, Judi Dench, Judith Anderson, Miranda Richardson, Flora Robson, Cate Blanchett, Helen Mirren, even Quentin Crisp, and most famously, and importantly, Glenda Jackson. 

And it must be said without doubt that Glenda Jackson's ""Elizabeth R"" is the defining portrait-- the most accomplished, historically accurate, and masterfully acted. Glenda Jackson is Elizabeth I reincarnate; there is simply none better, and likely never will be.

So now we have Anne-Marie Duff in the red wig for 230 Masterpiece Theatre minutes. Perhaps for the sake of revisionists, we are offered a far less imperious monarch, one who is both reactive (the real one was) and passive (the real one was not). Duff is an odd choice. No beauty like Cate Blanchett, but Elizabeth was known for vanity, not beauty. Duff's Elizabeth, with quivering lip and watercolor behavior, seems filmed underwater, and make for an undesirable monarch-- certainly not the Gloriana of myth or fact. Where is her famous wit, her coy manipulations, her strong moral fiber, her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers? Left with Glenda Jackson, I suppose. This Elizabeth is a simpering, love-struck maiden or a crass, 60-something hag (and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance). Hag works; crass manages; simpering loses the whole impact.

A suavely elegant, very attractive and distinctly healthy Queen Mary I opens Elizabeth's story (no Catharine Parr, no Thomas Seymour, no childhood) but is quickly dispatched. Just as well, for she's thoroughly ill-cast--Mary was none of those things. (Far better was the wonderful Kathy Burke in the Blanchett version, though she was a bit of a Protestant caricature). Daphne Slater in the Jackson series was far more appealing, and perfectly written. 

Elizabeth's transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life. No part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years-- the abuse by Seymour, imprisonment, exile, and finally her accession. Unfortunately, much of this key period is sped through. The fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast Elizabeth mooning incessantly over Robert Dudley, later Earl of Leicester, here played by a childish, petulant Tom Hardy. There is no chemistry here; he is pretty, but vacant. Glenda Jackson's Dudley, Robert Hardy (no relation that I know of), is a bit of a fop, but he knows his place in court and Elizabeth's heart. Their chemistry is clear. This version of Dudley is a bit ridiculous-- how he would claim the Queen's heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance. So is most of the casting (what's with the acrobat?)

An egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by Dudley's long-suffering wife Amy Robsart, whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery. More time should have been spent on the wooing of Elizabeth by the French Duc d'Alencon, who very nearly came to be her husband (again, the 1971 Glenda Jackson version handles this segment masterfully).

All too soon and without sufficient explanation, we become immersed in the historically key, decades-long battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous Mary, Queen of Scots-- Elizabeth's 2nd cousin, granddaughter of Henry VIII's older sister Margaret, whose claim to the English throne made her a rallying point of Catholics, and a very real threat to Elizabeth (it was Mary's son James who succeeded Elizabeth in 1603, founding the ill-fated House of Stuart). 

Far more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, which was Elizabeth's darkest hour-- forever bloodying her saintly propaganda. Likewise, more attention should have been given to Walshingham, Elizabeth's master of subversion, although William Cecil, Lord Burghley, is given fair due.

The decisive Armada happens much too quickly, lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of Elizabeth and Robert Devereaux, Earl of Essex, portrayed by Hans Matheson, who is cast and directed as a bad-tempered, bipolar ""Mama's Boy"" (a very strange Oedipal twist here) whose hair, look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585. The entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship, here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling. The casting is awful, the acting mediocre, the personality baffling. This Essex is a wreck-- blame the revisionist director.

Two significant annoyances: Elizabeth's (Duff's) accent isn't simply London middle-class, which would be fine, but stands in stark contrast to everyone else's appropriate English diction and clarity. She comes off as a guttersnipe. And worse of all-- distracting to the utmost-- is the incessant soundtrack that dominates--and not pleasantly-- the action and plot of the movie. The sheer volume of it is horrendous, to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with Essex's electric guitar.

My suggestion here is to rent this one, watch it as long as you can, and then return to Davis, Blanchett, Jackson, or even Dench. Overall, a disappointment. Were it not for 95% historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes-- plus the decent acting (most of the problems are the director's fault, don't blame the actors), it would have earned one star. But this Queen is no legend, and this cast is horrendous. An inglorious Gloriana.

1536,"	The legend reworked...
	To be fair, the legends of Herakles, as they were originally written, have little to do with this movie, but maybe that's for the best.  Having grown up on Superman, Batman and the Justice League, I have a hard time calling a person like Herakles a hero.  In the original legends, he was a warrior, but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage.  He also wasn't, as far as I can tell, as strong as in this version.
Therefore, interpretations of Herakles are, I think, to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend, but on where and why.
Disney has attempted to take Herakles (or Hercules, in the Roman) and make it a story about a true hero, and a perfect one at that.  There's nothing I like more than perfect heroes.  They inspire me.  Conceptually, I like the idea.
Instead of Herakles being the illegitimate son of Zeus and a mortal woman, he's conceived in love by Zeus and Hera and turned mortal by a potion.  Not bad.  As changes go, it works better than most.
Herc meets Meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him (another deviation from the legend, and a very good improvement.)  Of course, because Hera is his mother in this version, she can't be Herc's enemy, so they make his opponent Hades; lord of the dead, which could be worse, as changes go.  I've never seen Hades as being all that bad of a guy, but that's how it goes.  Then there's the Hydra, which is, if anything, much larger and more powerful than it was originally, so that's good too.  Aside from this, however, I have to say I was disappointed with most of the changes.
The titans, to start with, were underplayed considerably.  It might have been premature to mention that they were Zeus' predecessors, but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had, and a roughly-similar appearance.  Oceanus, for example, lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose, or Cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence, particularly since Hercules didn't beat the titans alone in the original stories, nor does it make sense that he should in this one (grabbing a whirlwind?  Come ON now.)
I actually didn't mind Hades' used-car-salesman demeanor all that much, though I didn't see a reason why he should have flame-based powers when that's clearly Apollo's territory.  Further, I thought most of the Gods and Muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature.
Why is this the case?  I think Disney made the mistake, in this film, of not just trying to make the legends clean, but FUN as well, and there's nothing fun about war.  I'm not saying they couldn't have made the concept work.  In fact, I'm saying they could have made it work if they'd toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect (Justice League style.)
Still, for what it's worth, this is one of the few movies left in the world that isn't afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero, and for that it's worth at least one viewing.  Rent it from your local video store, in my opinion, before you make your decision

	This is the first time I have ever purchased a ""The Firm"" dvd.  I was really disappointed in this one.  Many of the moves are not properly explained.  Some movements target only one side of the body and they don't bother having you switch sides to work the other.  (really obvious in the salsa style section) It took a few times of doing to get all the moves right, but even after that it barely raises the heart rate.  The warm up leaves much to be desired. The cool down continues the ""dance"" movements but at a ""slower"" rate and stretching the neck for one second on each side and the inner thigh for one second here and those are not enough to even make you realize that you are stretching. I am used to Denise Austin workouts, that are half the length but you actually feel like you did something when you are done.  Not so with this ""workout"" at all.  Definately a waste for someone who isn't just starting out.

	I have been a huge fan of L. M. Montgomery's work since I was an eleven-year old girl living in the Caribbean.  I've read and re-read, and re-read her stories again and again, and can't seem to get enough.  The first two film installments in the Anne of Green Gables story are warm, beautiful, funny, inspiring and moving pieces of work, that are more or less faithful to Montgomery's original novels.

The third installment is a travesty.

Anachronism, bad dialogue, bad plot and plain old bad acting plague this ""sequel"".  I say ""sequel"" in quotes, because the thing I dislike the most about the movie is the fact that the storyline is a complete departure from what Montgomery had envisioned for Anne so long ago.  What a way to end it.

That said, I've decided to purchase only the first two installments, and leave the third alone.  I prefer to have Anne and Gilbert live out their literary lives in my imagination, than to poison my memory of them with the drivel that is Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story

	ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.

I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.

but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.

take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.

so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one

But that's really my problem with this film. Serious themes are reduced to a series of shameful archetypes that come straight from the central casting. And they are ALL here: the homely black grandparents, the nation of Muslim converts to Islam, the socially conscious mother whose son begins to take the cocaine route... all characters who might do better in another film that treats these issues in a more subtle and deeper way. Take, for example, the French film ""la haine."" It has clearly taken a lot of inspiration from Threat 2 Society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, rather than just having many scenes written for them to show their torment.

And if you believe it, the hip-hop in ""la haine"" is much better. So while I would definitely recommend this movie, hold the remote control ready and press the quick forward button. Maybe half an hour of this film is really worth watching, while the other 70 minutes are mostly just boring moralising.

	Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it. 

The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a ""history"" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets ""evidence"" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge ""clues"" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.

In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else.

1563,"	Style WAY, WAY, WAY Over Substance
	I'm a fan of the 1999 ""The Mummy"" and was understandably looking forward to this sequel. In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.  

It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and ""The Mummy Returns"" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.  

""The Mummy Returns"" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Mummy Returns"" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball. 

Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. ""Returns"" put an end to that.

But after only 10-15 minutes I was completely detached from the picture again, although there were all sorts of exciting things, or at least things that should have been exciting. ""The Return of the Mummy"" has a lot to offer: a great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F / X, etc. It also has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately, it all boils down to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. ""The Mummy Returns"" does without the characters, and the plot is used only as a flimsy clothesline for action and F / X sequences. FINAL ANALYSIS: ""The Mummy Returns"" has so many ingredients, but somehow it fails completely. It's a genuine cinematic JUNK. It should be used in film lessons as the epitome of style over substance - with all the right elements, including budget, and in an amazing way to thwart the ball. Of course, this could have been a great movie franchise, but it wasn't to be."

	Charlize Theron, her real life boyfriend Stuart Townsend, and Penelope Cruz are all nice to look at, and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work, Theron having won as Osca for her role in Monster.

But Head In The Clouds is one of those beautifully filmed films starring a beautiful cast that trying to stay beautiful in an increasingly ugly world, particularly Europe in the 1930s. From the Spanish Civil War to World War II, the stories of these three people who share a Paris flat together is supposed to be a sweeping tragedy that shows how world events and fate can conspire to thwart true love.

Instead, it shows how silly things can be when you mix hedonism, narcissism, social responsbility, and sheer stupidity. You end up caring less about the characters, andwondering more how much more trouble will they get themselves in. This was a pretty stylish waste of time for everyone involved

	This movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  As a huge Colin Firth fan originally from a small town in Vermont, I thought that no matter what I had heard about the film I would enjoy it.  Unfortunately,  I was wrong. 
     
The main problem of the film was characterization.  There were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character's actions.  One minute, the small town girl played by Heather Graham is working at a nursing home, then she's downing alcohol, then she's jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason (in fact, she doesn't even seem drunk), and all this entices the character Colin Firth to jump into bed with her.  I think the Heather Graham character is supposed to be quirky, but because of the script and the way the film is cut, she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable.  Then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which Colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance (and this is no rebound relationship).  Basically, the movie continues along this vein, with Minnie Driver showing up as the dark-haired British ex-fiance who you can't see ever having had a relationship with Colin (both actors are better in the much superior movie Circle of Friends).  In any case, there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups/get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends.
    
Additionally, the setting is completely misused, beginning with the sign that says more than 18,000 people live in Hope.  In New England, that does not classify as a small town.  They could have used the autumn setting and American-ness of the people as restorative to the Colin character.  The suggestion of that is there, but it is never demonstrated - instead, they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the Heather Graham character downs a bottle of booze, and Colin Firth's character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town's people.  Although the hotel owners are fun, if unrealistic, the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character. 
    Finally, I don't neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie, with the wierd cutting, it may have seemed like a good idea at the time.  I think Colin Firth does his best at being an ambigious, but still likeable guy.  Heather Graham, aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all, has absolutely nothing to work with, so you can't even blame her for the horrendous character she has.  And everyone else, including Minnie Driver, is a complete caricature, although Minnie Driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film.
    I feel bad to judge this movie so harshly, but it is unneccessarily bad, and I had been hoping for something at least fun.  These actors all have much better movies out there.

I remember wanting to see this movie when I was younger (when it was first released), but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I bought the DVD in order to write a term paper comparing the film to actual history. In terms of Hollywood, it's fairly accurate. The film itself, as entertainment, is great (it seems some people are analyzing it as if it were a documentary???). I'm a fan of both Douglas and Kilmer; they're fine here, but they've definitely done better work elsewhere. The plot moves along nicely and creates some definite tension and suspense. Additionally, the photography is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, too.

Now the bad news: the DVD sucks. Period. And I'm not even complaining about the lack of extras here. The transfer is absolutely criminal, and those responsible for it should never work on another DVD project ever again. The print is clear and solid, but the aspect ratio is not correct AT ALL. I was mortified when I popped it into my player, only to be rewarded with a distorted image. Absolutely shameful...This film deserves a new anamorphic transfer in its original aspect ratio.

1570,"	Heavy-handed, Predictable, and Not Funny
	I did not much enjoy this film, and I didn't find it very clever or funny. 

It's true, as other amazon reviewers have noted, that Citizen Ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue. Does that make it an intelligent and even-handed comic treatment of a complex topic? No, indeed.

Along the way, it also stereotypes poor people, middle class people, teenagers, drug addicts, Christians, and Vietnam veterans. That doesn't make it funny, though, because the satire is so heavy-handed and predictable. Simply tackling an important social topic, like abortion, isn't going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor. In my opinion, the film's pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy. There were too many close-ups of earnest, wide-pored, and angry faces. And Burt Reynolds as the national leader of the anti-abortion crowd was just peculiar. What was he doing in this film? And what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young Eric?

Laura Dern is a talented actress, and she does a creditable job with this part -- which because it straddles genres was a challenging one. But her talent couldn't redeem this film for me

	I have never been a Demi Moore fan, but this movie is even worse than I imagined it would be. My kids picked it up in the videotheque. I decided to give it a fair chance and watched it together with them. Demi's acting is rather passionless, poor and disconnected. She looks old too ! She doesn't succeed at all in portraying a woman who is ravaged by the loss of her only child and by her own stupid fault and selfishness too. After just eight months after the tragedy she wanders off to some remote spot in Scotland to write a new novel. Yeah, sure. That's what I would do after losing my only child. I probably would be in utter shock for another 200 years or so. After five minutes you don't care at all what happens to her and what fate befalls her. You can see the few twists and turns in the plot coming miles before they happen. And all the illogical things start to get annoying very quickly. A guy who is alone on an island for years who doesn't know how to cook a fish and succeeds in burning it. And who puts the spare key to his home out in the open on the sill above the door in a place that is battered by gales almost weekly. A mobile phone that functions in the middle of nowhere. I expected a film with supernatural elements, but boy did I get fooled. Some of the photography and scenery was acceptable, but the CGI generated images of the lighthouse were done rather poorly.

	Half Light (Craig Rosenberg, 2006)

I've been following some heated debate about this flick on movie boards, and it's brought a somewhat related (if tangentially) point into focus for me: why it is that movies like Darkness, the 2002 Spanish ""thriller"" with all the suspense of a Pee Wee Herman monologue, and Haute Tension, France's painfully bad 2005 attempt at horror, come over to America and fall flat. Well, I knew the answer, but really, you're all providing me with more evidence. You've never seen a good horror film in your life, have you? Because that's really the only way I can see justifying Darkness, Haute Tension, or Half Light as marginal, much less good, movies.

Demi Moore plays Rachel Carlson, an American author living in Scotland with her husband Brian (Henry Ian Cusick) and their son Thomas (the wonderfully-named Beans el-Balawi, recently in the TV adaptation of Beneath the Skin). Thomas suffers a household accident, which leads to Rachel and Brian splitting up. Rachel's friend Sharon (Coupling's Kate Isitt) finds Sharon a lovely, secluded place on the coast to hole up and try to write (and why is it that dead kids always lead to parents going off somewhere secluded, where they're bound to be tormented by guilt?). Rachel meets a number of fine locals, including Angus McCulloch (The Mists of Avalon's Hans Matheson), keeper of an even more secluded lighthouse not far from her new place, with whom she feels an instant attraction. Despite being free of the marriage bond, Rachel's not quite sure what to make of her handsome stranger...

...and neither are we. There's obviously supposed to be chemistry between these two characters, but it's never realized. It's probably off looking for the film's suspense, which Rosenberg reminds us we're supposed to be feeling by inserting a few scenes that tread the ground of every suspense movie clichï¿½ in the entire book. Once you've figured out the movie's big twists (yes, there's more than one, handled with all the delicacy afforded to, say, a road being repaved), which you will have done less than thirty minutes into the film, Rosenberg attempts to hit you with another big twist at the end. There's only one problem-- the movie's climactic scene is so befuddling that any attempt at inserting another plot twist that leads to the film's resolution does nothing but leave the viewer confused and unsatisfied. (Go look at the film boards in various places. There is one question that crops up over and over again. It relates to the utter inability of the climax to get its point across.)

It's not often that I say Darkness is better than another horror film. After all, Darkness was about the most pointless exercise in mediocrity possible. But if you have died and gone to Hell, and you have a choice of which of the two to watch on endless loop for the rest of eternity, Darkness should be a no-brainer. Yes, this one's that bad.

Well, I knew the answer, but really, you all provide me with more evidence. You've never seen a good horror movie in your life, have you?

Although she has no connection to marriage, Rachel doesn't really know what to think of her handsome stranger... nor do we. Obviously the chemistry between these two characters is supposed to be right, but that's never going to happen. It's probably not the tension of the film that reminds us how to feel, inserting a few scenes that go to the bottom of every tension film clichÃ© - and that throughout the book. Once you've seen through the film's big twists (yes, there's more than one that's handled with all the subtlety you can afford, for example, on a road that's being repaved), which you've already accomplished after less than thirty minutes of the film, Rosenberg tries to give you a big twist at the end.

Maybe I'm not British, but I didn't find 24-hour party people very funny. Only a few scenes made me smile. The randomness did little to contribute to the overall quality of the film. The camera work was also very jerky. Looks like it was done by a newcomer (and yes, I am one myself after I made two movies), the only redemptive aspect is the scenes with Joy Division. It's a shame that the members of this band are minor characters. I can only hope that the Ian Curtis biopic, which is currently in production, will be much, much better"

	I'm very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does, I suppose most are simply glad the show is available on DVD.  However, the transfer to DVD is absolutely horrible.  On an opening night shot on disc 1, there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs -- inside the house!  The colors on these prints aren't even as good as what is shown on TVLand.  This show might be 30 years old, but they cannot be using the best prints available.  There is another irritating tip-off of the cheapness of this package -- the music on the closing credits is wrong -- or is this my imagination?

   For those who are defending this package, the upcoming Daniel Boone DVD set is a good item to compare it with.  That show aired in 1966 and the remastered print is fantastic.  Studios and re-issue companies can do a good job when they choose to.  It's a real shame that, in this age of big-screen TVs, this program will look so shoddy.  It's apparent that with such a popular show, they could have recouped the investment

1583,"	A Travesty
	First let me say that I thought Angela's Ashes was an absolutely terrific book and Frank McCourt fully deserved his Pulitzer Prize. This movie was a horrendous let down. No one involved with the film seemed to have a clue about how to depict real deprivation and poverty. Everything was a Hollywood version of suffering and misery, from Emily Watson's pretty red coat standing in for the real Angela's gray rag to the beautifully lit Irish streets and of course John ""let me tell you how you're supposed to feel right now"" Williams' cloying, inappropriate music. 

The acting from the children was great. They were absolutely the best part of the film. Of course, given the constraints of film and the average audience tolerance for unpleasantness such as oozing eyes, pimples and bad teeth all the kids were pleasing to look at, clear skinned and attractive. At least they could act! 

Emily Watson was given little to do. Robert Carlyle was good although Alan Parker seemed determined to sanitize the ambiguities of McCourt's father by only showing little episodes of drunkeness and thoughtlessness. 

Parker tends to be an extremely literal, by-the-numbers director with little understanding of subtlety (look what he did in the Pink Floyd's ""The Wall""). This time he  was clearly given a mandate by the Hollywood bigwig producers not to make the film too ""depressing"" or ""grim"" so that audiences would accept it. The film ends up being a choppy, gentrified, soulless version of one of the best modern books ever written.  Really a shame and a waste of resources.

	Well what can I say about this movie? Well one thing is: It wasn't what I'd expected. Those who'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but I still wanted to see it. I was wrong and they were right.
The movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild', bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care. 
Marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help' him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs.

1593,"	Not For Pre-Teens
	It is unfair to judge a children's film by the same non-technical standards you would judge a film made for a more mature audience. That said, I had a difficult time figuring out the intended target audience for Disney""s ""A Far Off Place"", an odd mix of ""Alaska"", ""Walkabout"", and ""Blue Lagoon"". Since each of these films had a different target audience (children for ""Alaska"", adults for ""Walkabout"", and teens for ""Blue Lagoon""), ""A Far Off Place"" suffers from a poorly matched and confused mix of story elements, the attempt to appeal to multiple target audiences ultimately makes it unappealing to all audiences.

Despite some positive comments on this database, ""A Far Off Place"" did not impress audiences at the time of its 1993 release and has generated little interest since. Based on stories by South African writer Laurens van der Post, ""A Far Off Place"" is the story of three teenagers: Nonnie (Reece Witherspoon as a girl raised on South African game preserve), Harry (Ethan Randall as a visiting American boy) and Sorel Bok (as their young Bushman guide Xhabbo) who attempt to evade a gang of ivory poachers by fleeing into the Kalahari Desert. Ethan Randall is actually Ethan Embry from ""Can't Hardy Wait"".

Although recommended for ages eight and up, most younger viewers will be deeply disturbed by the early scenes, where the family's idyllic life is ended by a night attack on their home by the poachers. The house is burned and the parents are murdered. And more mature viewers will be deeply disturbed by the next scene where Nonnie turns into Rambo and kills most of gang in a sequence credible only to a horrified eight-year old. 

At this point it begins to look like ""Walkabout"", a story of an Australian girl, her little brother, and a young Aborigine on his ritual journey to manhood. In a significant deviation from the book Xhabbo's wife does not accompany the group into the desert. 

""Walkabout's"" more adult theme of interracial sexual awakening is replaced by a ""Blue Lagoon"" romance between the two white teenagers, a reflection of the film's narrower values and more modest ambitions.

The scenes shot in the desert are almost the equal of ""Alaska"" for scenic beauty but ""Alaska""s"" more realistic survival challenges are superior to the blend of survival skills and mystic powers that Xhabbo demonstrates to his two companions during their journey. There is an element of ""The Gods Must Be Crazy"" in this clash of cultures but the film does not go very far (bad pun intended) with the concept. 

Both ""Alaska"" and ""A Far Off Place"" insert the element of poacher violence into the journey, to the detriment of the basic story. 'Walkabout"" did not need this and found sufficient story material in the enormity of the survival experience.

Bok is excellent as the young Bushman and Randall/Embry's performance is solid if unexceptional. Those interested in Witherspoon's early work would be better served checking out her great debut performance in ""The Man In the Moon"" and avoiding this career misstep. Those looking for a children/family story should stick with ""Alaska"".

1594,"	Postmodern American Teenyboppers meet Shaka Zulu
	Well, this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get, unfortunately: the female teenage protagonist (played by Witherspoon, whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here) acts masculine and heroic, the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant. At one ridiculous point, the girl runs around acting like a commando, a veritable one-gal army, blowing up the bad guys, while the boy hides in a cave sniveling. Later, when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal's backpack as they cross a desert, the gal snaps at him, Bella Abzug-style, and walks quickly ahead, leaving him in the dust. Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here, and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men. Of course, in the real world, the result for such manly girls, once they become women, is that men do not choose them and they remain alone, and therefore become bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men, of course. In this movie, the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy, masculine gal--but that's why they call them movies. When are these post-modern writers, artists, and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism, they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not prefer masculine females. Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them, not COMPETE with them. Men crave FEMININITY in females, not FEMINISM. Wow, is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie, at least his character does progress a little bit: by the end of the movie, instead of craven and flippant, he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut, if that is even a step upward. But the plucky gal--she's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations.
Uh, another problem with this movie--and there are many--is when the kids are going through the Kalahari Desert, something which should be, and for a time is here depicted as, a foreboding and life-threatening task. Yet we see Witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog; and we see the boy's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner, considering the dire situation they are in. The sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted, inane scenes.
Look, I dig Disney kid movies--more realistic ones. You know, old style Disney movies. You take ""Old Yeller"" for example. Now there was a quality kid movie, and quite true to life. 
This movie was not. It had a plastic, spoiled-American-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout. Disney has gone down the tubes. In any number of ways, they've been subverted by radical Marxist agendas (Note: One more of these was the fact that an African Bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his PC pagan religion--something called ""tapping,"" while the Caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-PC Judeo-Christian religion--this is bias, folks, leftwing, PC bias, same as the aforementioned feminist bilge). I am learning to run, not walk, away from Disney stuff, and this movie was further cause for me to do so.

History catches your attention. The detective is interesting, and his sledging is interesting. If you like a light whodunnit, you might like it. Virtually everything that is on TV today. I rated this 2-star episode, compared to ""Road to Avonlea, Third season"" mystery episode with Christopher Reeve, which I rate 4 stars. Not as clever as the TV series ""Columbo,"" but the timing could make up for that. It didn't have what I was looking for, some adventure, more credibility, more charm and more cleverness. The scenery is attractively ""staged,"" not the scenery that takes you there. Has pleasant characters, but not deep. A good mood among the staff.

Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?

primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and 
how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore

	There are two main reasons why this Superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects.

What Singer and company have missed is the heart of Superman - virtues.  The ideal of the American way (noticably absent) is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice.  Donner made the mistake in the 70's of having Superman sleep with Lois, and now Singer adds insult to injury by having Superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he doesn't take responsibility for (deadbeat dad).  Using his super powers to invade the privacy of Lois in her home, drags Superman down to the level of creepy (peeping tom).

The second issue concerns personality.  Routh and Bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry.  These are the two ingredients that made Reeves and Kidder so endearing.

A new director, writers, and cast is needed.  Until then, at least there's Superman 1.

	What looks like a good movie to watch quickly turns into disappointment. Whilst you expect some plot to come together (at least on first viewing) - it is strung together to confuse - even to frustrate the viewer.

I was given no warning about the really really bad quality. Having a HD Large display does not help either. The sound is annonying as is irritating. In fact I got a refund on the movie hire!

I don't expect overboard special effect and CGI overlays. I expected the quality to be above a cheap CAM recorder however.

The plot is complicated and the noise in the background adds to the disorientation which is done on purpose.

On the other note: The cheap and nasty props do not add anything to crediblility either.

Stay clear - but if you have the time and want to view the movie - settle back and expect a ""student"" movie from some high School college.

This movie although good in concept fails. I would like some production house to take it on board - create the situation with some convinving special effects (to help the storyline), better sound, widescreen and convincing props.

It could have been a brilliant movie but is spoiled by bad quality and unconvinving props.

Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching.

They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.  As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more.  I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment.  I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time.

	Cinema-wise, you know you're witnessing the beginning of the end when the best Hollywood can come up with is a SEQUEL to a REMAKE (it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film).  But that is exactly what ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" turns out to be - and the result, quality-wise, is pretty much what one would expect.

This is one of those alleged family comedies in which the adults (the male adults at any rate) are infinitely more immature in their attitude and behavior than the children they are raising.  Steve Martin returns as the prolific father of twelve who is beginning to sense that his children, as they are growing older, no longer want to spend quality time together as a family.  To rectify the situation, he takes them all on a vacation to a favorite lake resort - a move that threatens to turn into a full-scale disaster when the Bakers find themselves embroiled in a fierce competition with a neighboring family of snooty overachievers led by Eugene Levy, a patriarch who runs his brood with so much spit-and-polish regimentation that he makes Captain Von Trapp look like a touchy-feely pushover in comparison.

One might be tempted to call this a distended version of a ""Brady Bunch"" episode and leave it at that, but even that show, for all its lack of sophistication, didn't portray the father as a total and irredeemable doofus with serious developmental issues and the emotional maturity of a bratty six-year-old.    Besides the daddy-is-a-dope stereotype, all ""Cheaper by the Dozen 2"" has to offer is lame slapstick, a silly pre-pubescent ""Romeo and Juliet"" subplot, and push-button scenes of emotional uplift in which a crescendo of swelling violins serves as the cue for the tears to start flowing.  The drearily unoriginal screenplay comes replete with the requisite dog-humping incidents and poop jokes, and not one but TWO scenes of an elderly handicapped gentleman rolling off into the lake in a wheelchair.

However, despite its lack-luster performance, the film did serve a purpose in the classroom.

True, the film leaves something to be desired. They change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them.  Editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story.  Rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely.  Major events in the rising action are left out, thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing.  Overall, very few of my students liked the film adaptation of Jane Yolen's novel, which they found so riveting.  
On a brighter side, because of so many differences, viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through T-Charts and Venn diagrams.  It also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills.

	Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole ""We're married and my husband's a doctor."" charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and ""Dr. Holmes"" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?

What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.

Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?

Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us ""don't do it!"" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!

It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap

1624,"	Poor man's truth serum: caffeine and sugar.
	There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.

Where did Eye for an Eye go wrong?  I don't think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters.  I have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.  What was Sally Field's job?  I know that is a small detail, but it better highlights my complaint that our central family (the McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed.  Ed Harris literally walked through his character, proving that Field's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion.  The only character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end.  Yet, we didn't even know that much about him either (which upset me).  Schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well, the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn't even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from the beginning, but it wasn't what I wanted to see.  I expected film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996.  It was pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan.  Nothing stood out in this film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and nothing made me feel excited about these actors.  This was a literal ""nothing"" film.  It lent nothing to the cinematic world except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired genre known as the ""Revenge Thriller"".

After watching this film I said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me think of a High School drama production.  It was amateur at best, but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is known for being overly dramatic.  This is a pure example of a good thing gone badly.  Sally saw success with it once, but as she continues it only creates bad cinema.  There were times during Sally's bigger speeches that I found myself laughing.  I couldn't help myself, but her focus on certain words and clichï¿½ reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike.  The same could be said for Ed Harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the outlaying father any further in films.  He was completely wasted in this film.  Was there any emotion with him?  I didn't see any.  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes.  Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clichï¿½?  Urg, his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers.  Again, the only actor worth watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile.  It was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.  

If I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go mad myself.  Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer.  Did Kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path.  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers.  This was yet another dark avenue that was not explored.  I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world.

Overall, in case it wasn't obvious, this wasn't a good movie at all.  In fact, I could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again.  I thought only horror movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye it became obvious that it the ""Revenge Thrill"" fell into that same pattern.  The only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not.  Sally Field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while everyone else was forgettable.  The only fun part was watching Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil.  Watch this film for Kiefer, but nothing else.  Skip it!

1625,"	Only for Kiefer
	This is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up.

The movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland's character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title.

In one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her.

I don't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity.

I would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. ""Ssssssorry"", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like.

I think she wanted people to take her work seriously, and with this awfully made film, no one did. To others, the film might be so bad it's funny, but to devoted fans of the book it's just depressing. The movie was made in 1967, a year after the book was published and you can see that Jacqueline Susann was ahead of her time, because the film is poorly adapted and very censored. You know you have a problem when the book would receive an R rating if transferred onto the screen, but the movie is only rated PG. Besides the sex scenes, language, pill popping and other thematic elements that are left out, important details to the plot are also missing.

I don't care if the movie would have been almost three hours long, I think if they had stuck close enough to the book, then everything would have been fine. What a shame. And please don't mention the casting of actors. Save for Patty Duke, I thought everyone else did a horrible job. Some of the actors didn't even look the physical part (in the book Anne is actually a blonde, Helen Lawson has dark hair and Jennifer is curvy). The thing that really gets me though is why has this film never been remade? It's almost forty years later, and I think that this story definately deserves to be given justice and have a proper film adaptation. How about Kate Bosworth as Anne Welles, Scarlett Johansson as Jennifer North, Keira Knightly as Neely O'Hara, Joaquin Phoenix as Lyon Burke, and Liza Minnelli as Helen Lawson?

There are too many terrible moments for this to be romantic. History has so much more potential. The only reason I see this film is because of Catherine McCormack. Rufus Sewell is always good, too. Otherwise, the casting is absurd. Fred Ward and Oliver Platt stand out as misfits. Jacqueline Bisset is not convincing here"

While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.

But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging..

You haft to make people believe in you and really reach them and relate. If only Prince could relate to what people are feeling now and what they want. Prince somehow fell behind because the youth of this generation moved on while he stayed stagnet. I think he shut the world out and it just went on turning. Record sales may not matter to him, but fans you must keep loyal. Graffiti bridge is a film in my collection and I just look at it as my collection but nothing more. It's a film that makes you think. It's spiritual and there are some warm moments. Now Purple Rain is something not to be missed. I recommend that one. Enjoy

Don't blame the kids, you have only to look at the state of the world to see the utter failure that so-called educated people have already created everywhere, with world fascism now its ultimate fruitage, and the kids at some level know it...Clearly we urgently need a new vision of education altogether, but this film only asks us to glorify what has already died...

1647,"	I'M SORRY... I FIND THIS BADLY WRITTEN. spoilers!
	Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.

I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.

But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.

By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....

The script is idiot from page one.
The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.

But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.

Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.

Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.

Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????

Want more?

In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???

In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).

First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive.
Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.

We have none of that here.

Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.

Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.

But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under ""The story ends bad"" label. Without any depth.

Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.

What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the ""this is an open-ending"" kind of talk!

Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel?
Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: ""Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!""

Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great.

But then I realized that if you're reviewing a DVD, 90% of the review must be based on the movie itself, and having saw the movie when it was released, and having seen it again on the various cable channels, I felt I could write a respectable reveiw.

Frankly, the movie barely approaches a ""B-Movie"" status. It's only claim to fame is that it was the first major Hollywood motion picture that did not portray homosexuals in a bad light.

The plot is rather unbelievable, naming the fact that all three main characters are leaders in their field.... successful author, high-ranking network producer, top-rate doctor. Nobody has a profession, or is in a position, with which the audience can relate. The dialog is forced and, at times, rather cliche. Acting is acceptable, though supporting cast members are rather amateurish. Direction is functional, at best.

One glaring problem is the tendency for the movie to suddenly switch from drama to documentary. After or before key scenes, the camera cuts to a monologue from one of the main characters. The effect is startling, doesn't advance the story, and only serves to distract the viewers and lessen the already-weak emotional impact of the film.

To its credit, the actors did whole-heartedly portray gay characters and gay love scenes. At the time, gay characters were never portrayed in a positive light from the media, and it was a great risk to do so here. There were no previous movie experiences of this topic that the director and actors were able to draw on, and they did the best they could.

It was a very ambitious project and was supposed to be ground-breaking and revolutionary, but the weaknesses in the film never raised it high enough to truly make much of a difference in society. This is absolutely proven by the fact that Brokeback Mountain, released about two decades later, had to work very hard to break the same stereotypes that Making Love previously attempted to break. The difference is that Brokeback Mountain was a true work of art impeccable in its execution and actually broke ground and stereotypes, and Making Love all but disappeared in the annals of time.

If you're a collector of good film, this really wouldn't be part of your collection. To add into a collection of films showing early portrayals of homosexuals and homosexual relationships, it would be very appropriate. Sadly, it really is good for only that one reason, as part of a collection of gay films throughout the years

1661,"	Overrated, juvenile writing
	This series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12-year-old, but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters. Most of the plot's famous ""unpleasantness"" is just tacked on to the main story, and is of no significance.

Apart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses, nothing much gets accomplished thought the series. The main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series, so don't bother waiting for any meaningful information from her. The male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he's been transported to, inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him.

The most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman, who's included in the story for no reason except to be abused- you can almost hear the writers saying, ""I got it! Let's rape a little girl, that'll make it REAL! Yeah, Yeah, I like it!"" Having served her purpose, the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series, so a little more misery can be dumped on her.

All the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation. The releative standout would be the villian, who suffers from bipolarism, and alternates between terror, anger, delight, and misery, somtimes all within the same scene. Too bad that was about all he did in the show.

Well, that's about enough. If you have an appetite for ""Kid saves alternate universe"" themed anime, then you may like this. But I found it lifeless and massively overrated

1662,"	Gay Men With Mullets and Celtic Accents
	Alexander is portrayed as a neurotic and tortured individual who is shoved into power and conquest by his mother and turned into a monster by lust for authority. The character in this movie appears to have very little in common with the ambitious and thoughtful young man described by Aristotle. Watching this movie you get the feeling that Alexander and his men were a gang of sexually confused young boys who conquered the ancient world pretty much by accident.

There is far too much emphasis here on the non-essential, and every conflict in this story is a contrived account of Alexander's strained relationships with his mother, father, friends and his own identity. If you're looking for a narrative on the epic story of the most important figure of ancient Greece, look elsewhere. This is the story of insignificant things in the life of a man who happened to be significant.

	The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat ""hero"" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed

1668,"	I Don't Get It
	There is one thing I finally grasped upon watching 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', however.  I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ('The 40 Year Old Virgin') are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas.

Of course, they're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for, and laugh at, anything.

This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did/does on 'The Office', and people just love those mannerisms (Ricky Gervals is better in the same role, by the way...but that's neither here nor there).   It certainly couldn't be because it's funny.

The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise.  That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not.  

That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive, yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not.  

That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not.

That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not.

You get the drift.  Maybe the boat left and I wasn't on the boat.  Maybe I'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles.

If you like juvenile humor, watch something like 'Better Off Dead' or 'Caddyshack'.  Watch a movie that doesn't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh.

	For a topic this edgy, this is an incredibly dull film. The actors are good enough, mind you. But they can only do so much, because the real problem with this film is the script. For the first twenty minutes or so of screen time, the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented Natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother. (You *might* not pick up on that fact at first, since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film--certainly the two *look* nothing alike.) Finally the main part of the plot begins, with Natalie just as discontented, despite being married to a wealthy and quirky-but-ultimately-nice guy (Alan Rickman, for whose sake I watched this film at all--not worth it), and with her brother seemingly happy with his life, but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister. From that point, things spiral--no, that's too dynamic a word to describe it--*mosey* out of control, with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair, the poor brother (the only particularly sympathetic character in the film) becoming obsessed with the relationship, and the worried hubby's suspicions growing (although not in the right direction). There's so much here that *could* have been fascinating and compelling, but isn't, on any level. The plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi-believable situation, scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet. This video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops--mercifully for the public--but I certainly wouldn't recommend resorting to buying it.

1676,"	Really pretty dull for such a button-pushing topic
	I wasn't impressed by this film.   First of all, I could never ""buy"" that Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen were a brother and sister.  Nothing in their mannerisms or physical appearances would lead you to believe that they are related.  Nor does the backstory provided by the film give any credibility to their supposed brother-sister relationship.  They might as well have been unrelated lovers having a difficult relationship due to their massive immaturity and character problems, because that's how the relationship came across. 

Personally, outside of the button-pushing topic of incest, I found this movie dull and sometimes tawdry.  Clive Owen looked and acted like a low-grade truculent Lawrence Harvey, and Saskia Reeves was simply annoying (like her character, a weak, hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man.) The only actors who showed any real feeling were Alan Rickman as the husband, and Karl Johnson as Clive Owen's AIDS-stricken boss.  Karl Johnson has the best scene in the film:  he goes to a meeting with sores around his mouth and in a wheelchair, obviously suffering from AIDS, and this very fact intimidates the guy he's gone to meet.  The man keeps trying to subtly jerk his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the Karl Johnson character, and in the end Karl Johnson seizes the guy's sandwich and bites it, then offers the other guy a bite, pushing the sandwich into his face, basically...it's a scene that crackles with his anger   pain at being trapped by this illness, which is going to kill him, while this corrupt and self-important man is able to function normally.  

But aside from that wake-up call, the film dragged, and by the time Clive Owen's character was shouting in the climatic scene his realization that he's been used by his ""sister"" to inflate her sense of self-importance, I was long gone, with my head nodding.  

Much ado about nothing, frankly.  One star for the soundtrack; one star for the performances of Alan Rickman (what little he has to work with, he shines) and Karl Johnson.  Die-hard Clive Owen fans such as myself; eeeh, pass on this.
",0,"Really quite boring for such a button-pressing topic that this film did not impress me. First of all, I could never ""buy"" Saskia Reeves and Clive Owen being siblings. Nothing in their manners or physical appearance would lead you to believe that they are related. The back story presented in the film also gives no credibility to the alleged brother-sister relationship. They might as well have been unrelated lovers who had a difficult relationship because of their massive immaturity and character problems, because that's how the relationship came about. Personally, apart from the incest theme, I found this film boring and sometimes distasteful. Clive Owen looked and acted like a substandard Lawrence Harvey, and Saskia Reeves was just annoying (like her character, a weak, hopeless drifter from job to job and man to man). The only actors who really did make a difference were Alan Rickman as the husband and wife, and Clive Owen as the boss. Karl Johnson has the best scene in the film: he goes to a meeting with wounds to his mouth and in a wheelchair, obviously suffering from AIDS, and it is this very fact that intimidates the guy he has met. The man tries again and again to subtly pull his uneaten lunch away from any contact with the character Karl Johnson, and in the end Karl Johnson grabs the guy's sandwich and bites it, then offers the other a bite and pushes the sandwich in his face... it's a scene that crackles with rage because he's trapped by this disease that will kill him, while this corrupt and self-absorbed man can function normally. But apart from that wake-up call, the film dragged on, and when Clive Owen's character in the climactic scene screamed his realisation that he was being used by his ""sister"" to inflate her self-esteem, I was long gone, with a nod to that. Much ado about nothing, frankly. A star for the soundtrack; a star for the performances of Alan Rickman (with whom he has little in common, but shines) and Karl Johnson.

	This DVD is quite expensive but yields little to justify the cost.  The film lacks any real drama and becomes terribly boring after the first ten or so minutes.

In all honesty, as much as I enjoy movies of the Civil War, I'd like to return this for a refund.  Alas, that's a prospect that has,indeed, gone with the wind.  Thumbs down to this one

	YOU, ME AND DUPREE is a formula film, a template designed for teenage guys who feel the need for potty mouth, noisy, crude guy things movies.  There have been a lot of these films of late (all spinoffs of The Wedding Crasher image) and one wonders if there is a saturation point.

Relating the story is rather pointless as it is a one-line joke (?).  Dupree (Owen Wilson playing Owen Wilson) is the best man at his buddy Matt Dillon's wedding to Kate Hudson (the You and Me) and subsequently moves in with them, causing all manner of mayhem and bad taste and faux pas and grim situations (think toilet problems etc).  And that is it.  Michael Douglas was brought in to play a flat role as Kate Hudson's father who objects to her marriage blah blah blah. Ask directors Anthony and Joe Russo for the rest. 

We know that Hudson, Dillon and Douglas have much better roles to offer (Wilson seems to have found his niche), and the only reason films like this keep getting made is because they make money (for some reason) at the box office.  The film is silly, tacky, tired and should only be rented if the shelves in the video store are otherwise empty...   Grady Harp, November 06

This unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like The Jury, Please or The Phantom of The Opera. I expect Mr. Butler to be past these B films and know he does have much better stuff in the works...than goodness.

All in all the film was terrible. The scenery was captivating and breathless. I at times found myself saying wow, but it was about the story of Beowulf   Grendel and it did not meet my expectations that I have read even in the easiest translations. All I can say is Mr. Butler your an incredible talent, becareful what you choose. Movies like this can paved the way to a downward spiral. I know Mr. Butler is indeed better than this.

Still, it was a great cast; Dean Martin was particularly adept at westerns, much more so than Frank Sinatra, who pretty much plays Frank Sinatra in this one. It is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies, in this case, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress. The bad guys are well represented by Victor Buono and Charles Bronson.

	Beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that.  Was real disappointed by 9th Gate.  This film is tepid, there is none of the satanic intensity/ambiance that you find in 'Rosemary's Baby' It's too Hollywood, surprisingly, considering the maverick presence of Depp/Polanski. Film opens well, with a suicide and Depp's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence, but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere.  Exorcist 3, which I was equally disappointed in, at least was more satanic.  I won't spoil anything for those who do want to see it, but the showdown scene between Depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed.  Emmanuelle Seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a Demona. And the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least.  This film could have been great but Polanski dropped the ball, considering he was the producer/director/co-screenwriter, and the film fails in all three areas. It's not horrible, so I give it 2 stars.  But don't buy this film, rent it only.  Buy Angel Heart instead

This film is lukewarm, there is no satanic intensity / atmosphere like in ""Rosemary's Baby."" It's surprisingly Hollywood considering the idiosyncratic presence of Depp / Polanski. The film starts well, with a suicide and Depp's opportunistic character seeming to break the moral fence, but he never manages to create the right mood or atmosphere.

	The first set was very entertaining--a spy/crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by Moore and Curtis--Set II is another kettle of fish altogether.  The second set is strictly played for laughs--there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin.  Frankly, I hoped for more. 

For those who wish to obtain a true collector's set of this highly entertaining series, would do better to purchase the Network DVD Megaset Special Edition of The Persuaders, now available thru AmazonUK with some delighful extras including bumpers, promotional materials, episode commentaries, tv spot interviews, title sequences, and hour-long interviews with director, Robert Baker, Tony Curtis, and Roger Moore.  Tony Curtis' unabashed comments regarding the production team,  guest-star Joan Collins's antics on the set, and his marijuana bust en route to London for the taping of the first episode, are absolutely priceless in this Network DVD set.  

Surprisingly, the acute observer will notice that some of the episodes in the second box of the A E set are written by none other than Terry Nation--who would go on to pen a bigger and more serious series SURVIVORS in the UK four years later-when will that be available in the US?

Basically, Van Damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities, and forces him into a stiff choreographed position. They found some buff guys, okay, big deal. They put them in a film, and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills. These guys don't have that. Vin Diesel has far better choreography by himself.

	Okay, this movie is a complete waste of time for even the most diehard college basketball fans. 
Nick Nolte does a fine job acting like Bob Knight coaching UCLA, or in this case, the fictional Western Univ. That is until the 'real' Bob Knight coaches Indiana against Nolte's fictional team in the climactic game at the end. 
I was a student at IU when Nolte was going to every Indiana home game in order to study how a real college basketball coach acts. At the time Indiana was number 1 in the nation so Nolte got a lot of attention for his role. However, the acting by Shaq, Hardaway, and Matt Nover was absolutely HORRID!
The plot centers around a legendary b-ball court (Nolte as a Knight rip-off right down to the sweater) who is turned to cheating by those nasty alumni and boosters. He takes his dirty team through the season and plays number 1 Indiana at the end. The Real Bob Knight shows up with a cast of former IU b-ball legends and one Duke legend in Bobby Hurley. Anyway, after beating the squeaky clean Indiana team Nolte rats out the alums and boosters for their recruiting violations.
Other than Nolte nobody gives a really solid performance. Mary McDonnell is good but she's hardly in the movie. Bob Cousy plays the AD and he does an okay job for a guy who isn't even an actor. Hardaway is terrible and Matt Nover is just plain horrible.
The only part really worth watching is the final game between Indiana and Shaq's team. It does a good job of taking you inside the huddle as you actually see and hear Knight diagram plays and Nolte does the same. However, it just turns into a highlight reel of Shaq dunking. 
If you want to see a good b-ball movie just watch Hoosiers again. Also, I'd like to be on whatever mind altering drugs the people who gave this movie 5 stars were taking.

	Wuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion, betrayal, madness, despair, greed, hatred, and revenge. It's not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book. 

Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters' works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both.  

As Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean. 

Even if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O'Conner's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary.

This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests!

Apparently ""Home On The Range"" was meant to be released before ""Brother Bear"" but because of story issues it was delayed. I don't think it should have been made in the first place. It has also ruined the work laid out by ""Brother Bear"" for a new Disney renaissance. I think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired, because not only is it terrible, but it ended mainstream 2-D animation for Disney, a massive loss to the entertainment industry.

The DVD has an audio commentary (with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster). There is also a behind the scenes featurette, games, art review and music video- more than this movie that never should have happened deserves.

Now, if you've read her bio, and know what was going on with her and Holden, that could explain it, but still, this film is very static.
   Like most Heburn films, a highlight is her clothes, her style, her self.  This film self-consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better.  There are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here.  This film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead.  Jayne Mansfield could have been a hoot in this, Thelma Ritter too, in a very different way, somebody with less style and more off beat snap, crackle, and pop.  (Thelma Ritter and William Holden paired in a romantic comedy... I'm all ready laughing!)
   Before I hit this too harshly, this film was intended to be a trifle, the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles.  For that, it is adequate.
   The remake, ALEX AND EMMA suffers very much from the same problems.  They actually improved the script, and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices, but both films seem to have suffered from ""settling for a star"" when a less mainstream, more zany actress was needed.

1739,"	Coyote Ugly
	Alright: take a step back, and tell me there isn't something decidedly wrong, even militantly spooky, about the American Southwest. 

You know what I'm talking about? No? Let me clarify, then.

We're driving, Me   Thee, across some barren stretch of ancient Arizona moonscape, and we've hit upon what I call the Magic Hour: when the Day is laying down its sword in honor of Old Man Night, and the setting sun is really firing up all those sleeping reds and oranges and deep, feral yellows, up on the rocks, the hills, the cliffs, the crags, the bluffs. 

Can you see it? Can you hear the coyotes keening and wailing and hi-yi-kee-yi-ing away back up in some box canyon, where those black-rooted stunty trees wave their straggly, evil, twisted arms towards an absentee Heaven? 

We still think of America as a young country, and maybe that's just our innocence talking. Because this land is just as ancient as any trod by the African or Chinese, and can't you just smell the Terrible Old Blood-Secrets buried down under the Earth when you're out on the high desert?

Sure. As the town of Desperation's former Sheriff (former, in that he's going through something of a---ah, Midlife Crisis) would say, Gosh, yes. 

The guts and sheer, pulpy, bloody visceral glory of Stephen King's novel ""Desperation"" rides that seam of ancient, buried, hulking horror like a 40-something housewife saddling up the mechanical bull at Gilley's, and that's half its charm---which is why I was expecting so much with Mick Garris's cinematic version, and, no doubt, why I was just so damned disappointed. 

The setup, the build, the execution---everything about ""Desperation"" cuts thematically close to the territory King marked with his bad-doggie tale ""Cujo"". Remember ""Cujo""? Something ancient and unspeakably evil, and deeply stupid and hungry---something nasty lies all coiled-up in a dark cave.Until Cujo---big, bumbling, naive, benevolent---comes lumbering into its domain. 

And gets eaten. Devoured. Turned into a shambling, rabid hulk of its former lovable slobbery self, transformed into a ravenous engine of death with one single design: to spread carnage, red and raw and toothy, across the trembling land. 

Now, just as the arc and trajectory of the bullet isn't all that mindful of its casing, so too the unsleeping Ancient Evils of Cujo and Desperation aren't too picky about their corporeal hosts. Whether it's a 300-pound dog or a 300-pound lawman, the only real concern is where to pile the bodies. 

Or so you'd think. Sadly, ""Desperation"" is a tiny little bang, and a ton of whimper: 15 minutes of shivery brilliance, and what feels like about 8 hours of unbridled dullness. 

That bristling tale of ancient, sleeping, hungry Evil---Tak ripped out of his slumber with the explosion of the charges in the Rattlesnake Pit, and his unquenchable desire to eat his way out into the guts of the little town of Desperation---all of the novel's frantic hardscrabble fight against a mounting, relentless Evil is wasted by Mick Garris's listless, uninspired direction. 

It's as if Garris burned up his budget hiring Ron Perlman to run the numbers as Collie Entragian, and then outsourced the rest of the flick to Bangalore. Hell, they even dragoon some worn-out mountain lion to take a chunk out of flabby old Charles Durning's patooshka, and even that doesn't jack up the Excite-O-Meter on this miserable thing. 

Not that I'm complaining about Perlman: this sad little flick bumps and grinds and gets its Crawling Kingsnake groove-on *only* when Entragian is on the screen, and Perlman is the perfect choice as the Lawman who goes all Economy on us and squeezes both Good Cop *and* Bad Cop into one body, then goes on to Downsize his jurisdiction. With extreme prejudice. Tak! 

""Desperation"" has its 15 minutes of brilliance with that fatal traffic stop: everything is just about note perfect. Those lying, impossibly high wild-blue Western skies; the Trooper lurching out of his cruiser, that Gary Cooper drawl just crackling out over the silence of the High Desert, the spike of Dread at the curt command to step out of the car succeeded by a queasy flood of relief when---thank God!---it's just a busted-tail-light. 

It's here, in the seconds before ""Desperation"" lurches forward zombie-style into B-grade horror, that the movie succeeds, that it creeps and crawls the way the book did. It is here that the film conjures up the loneliness of the Vast Stretches, the realization---something most American suburbanites go to their graves without knowing---that there are wild spaces on this crazy planet where you could be murdered and buried without anyone knowing how, or why. 

While the coyotes howl, the scorpions scuttle and clatter, the black widows stalk and spin and move itchingly towards their prey.

Gosh, yes.

It turns out I didn't miss anything, that's the way it was filmed. When I heard the film was available on DVD and ""R"" rated, too, I vowed to rent it and see the movie as it was designed to be seen. Curses, gore, adult scares and, perhaps a booby! One wouldn't expect anything but the most watered down presentation on ABC but the ""R"" rated version, oh boy!

The DVD, rated ""R"", was EXACTLY the same presentation word for word and scene for scene with the only difference being the exclusion of commercials. I'm going to say, and prove me wrong, that the ""R"" rating was slapped on the DVD to intice people to rent it to see the original adult version. What a sneaky rip-off. How can they do that?

Overall, the movie was not great. The ending was completely tacked on and I got a little tired of the sermonizing. The performances were OK, with the exception of Ron Perlman's performance. He was outstanding.

I know Amazon sells this DVD but they also sell the book and the book is much more satisfying. It's hard to believe the same guy that wrote the movie also wrote the book. I'm sure everybody made lots of money on this project but I'd like my money back

1751,"	What For Pussycat?
	I am a big fan of Woody Allen and I presume that I will eventually get around to seeing all of his movies.  Prior to viewing ""What's New Pussycat?"", I would have presumed that I would enjoy each and every movie.  However, ""What's New Pussycat?"" has shown me that even Woody Allen can make a disaster movie.

What is wrong with this movie is just about everything.  The acting can only do so much with an impossibly awful script and a director who seems to want to magnify the faults rather than cover them up.  We start with a man whose problem is that he must seduce every acttractive woman he sees.  Peter O'Toole won the rights to play this character and he is surrounded by beautiful women.  He proceeds to make it all seem so boringly ridiculous.  He calls all his femine friends ""pussycat"" which gets old after a while.  He constantly displays a bewildered expression coupled with a rather interested/disinterested approach toward his playmates.  He seeks the help of a sexually challenged psychiatrist played by Peter Sellers.  Sellers does his best with what little he has to work with.  He has the Dr. Strangelove accent down pretty good and he is constantly on the make but the humor that emerges is so weak as to be embarassing at times.  Woody Allen wrote the script, which is the most shocking disappointment of the whole picture.  I once heard a comedian remark that a good comic writer can give you 10 new jokes of which you can use 3.  With Woody Allen, the comedian said, you can use all 10.  In ""What's New Pussycat?"", I wish there HAD been at least three good jokes.  This overlong look into the problems that O'Toole's character suffers from eventually attempts to save itself with a sort of Bennie Hill-style slapstick.  I take that back; there's no justifiable reason to besmirch the good name of Bennie Hill by associating it with this turkey.  Anyway, the movie ends in a chateau with a sort of musical beds involving all of O'Toole's mistresses.  An incomprehensible brouhaha ensues and the revelers escape to a neighboring go-kart track.  (Presumeably all fashional French Chateaus have a conveniently adjacent go-kart track).  This enables the movie to sink so low that it boggles the mind.  After all, we have some top talent in Allen, Sellers and O'toole and we see them spontaneously go go-kart-riding off into the sunset (or the side of a building, or a mud puddle, or something meant to be funny).  I was glad to be done with the movie.

Woody Allen is a great talent.  Peter Sellers was a great talent.  Peter O'Toole was a great talent.  Watch them in their other productions but spare yourself the one movie that each one of them should not have made
",0,"What Pussycat Dolls? I'm a big fan of Woody Allen and I expect to see all his movies at some point. Before adding: 'What's new about Pussycat? ""I thought I'd enjoy every single movie,"" he said. But ""What's New Pussycat?"" showed me that Woody Allen can make a disaster movie, too. What's wrong with this film is pretty much everything. Acting can only do so much with an incredibly awful script and a director who wants to magnify rather than cover up the mistakes. We begin with a man whose problem is that he has to seduce every actress he sees. Peter O'Toole has secured the rights to the character and is surrounded by beautiful women. He goes on to make everything seem so boringly ridiculous. He calls all his female friends ""Pussycat,"" which gets old after a while. He shows a confused expression all the time, paired with a rather interested / disinterested attitude towards his playmates. He seeks help from a psychiatrist who is sexually harassed and played by Peter Sellers. Sellers do their best with the little they have to work with. He has the accent of Dr. Strangelove pretty well and he's always at work, but the humour that comes from it is so weak that it's sometimes embarrassing."

The writing is atrocious, and while the actors should be given credit for not choking on the swill they have for dialogue, they are completely unbelievable.  The story is utterly predictable, though it goes off on pointless tangents and ignores potentially interesting subplots, and the only thing surprising is that anybody ever thought it would be a good idea to make this drivel.  It doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency, with terrible editing, pathetic sound, and blatant continuity problems.

1758,"	English Soundtrack Version Vastly Inferior to the Hong Kong Original
	Can someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered DVD version of this film with Chinese audio and English subtitles?  The recent Hong Kong Legends release is crazy: Chinese audio, or English audio, but NO English subtitles!  

I have the original Chinese language/English subtitled (the subtitles are imbedded) version of this movie on a Universe VCD and, based on the merits of its available Chinese audio/English subtitles alone, it is a better movie--by magnitudes--than the one(s) commercially available to the (hapless) U.S. market.  

The English dubbing on this DVD, even though well synchronized with the actors' lips, takes so much away from the film nevertheless, especially its ""Chinese-ness,"" which is a major reason I enjoy this movie genre.  Take, for example, the scene where our hero first returns to Jing Woo School after learning of his master's death and sees First Senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master.  After handily defeating the challenger, First Senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the English soundtrack completely (and deplorably) misses.  Also, at the very end of the U.S. release film, Chen says he is going back to his Japanese girlfriend.  In the original, Hong Kong release, he actually goes off to fight the Japanese with the resistance movement.  Between these two examples, there are many such, gross audio mis-cues; enough, at least, to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film: the best of Jet Li's filmography, and perhaps the best of the ""modern"" Martial Arts genre, period.

The same criticism holds true for Jet Li's The Tai Chi Master (released in the U.S. as the English-dubbed Twin Warriors).  It's an English soundtrack superimposed over a Chinese movie, often stripping the film of its unique cultural content/identity/nuance, forcing the film through an American ""knock-down-shoot-'em-up"" template and reducing the potential for mental (as opposed to strictly visceral) enjoyment to a pitiful minimum.  We end up with a film typically devoid of humor, character development and silver screen ""intimacy,"" a film precariously out of balance with, and far flung from, its careful directorial intent.

If you value the full content--visible and audible--of Chinese martial arts films, but lack facility in the host language, then the next best thing is a well-subtitled, original language version.  And this release clearly is not that--by a long, long, long shot.

1761,"	The film that condemns itself
	Of course the Criterion Collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer. The problem is the film itself.

Preston Sturges made some genuinely profound films such as The Lady Eve, Unfaithfully Yours, and Hail the Conquering Hero that are rich and complex experiences. But Sullivan's Travels is   simplistic, pretentious, and false.

As the film's characters themselves point out, poverty is only intersting to the rich, whose view of it is distorted. Odd-faced character actors in dingy sets make a rich man's view of poverty and not at all related to the real thing. Sturges was one of the most highly-paid men in America, so his view of the subject matter is (like characters say in the film) based on cliche.

The climax with its chain-gang laughing at a cartoon, is pretty dopey and a fairly unconvincing argument for comedy. Sturges would do better to point to how comedy in his best films allows him to examine self-deception, angry love, role playing and a host of other themes--in other words how humor gets into the darkest and most ambigous areas of human life that ""serious"" drama cannot so easily reach.

This film is exactly the kind of film that Sullivan wants to make--which is why it is so overearnest and uninteresting.  

If you want to see the genious of Preston Sturges, watch any of his other films (even Harold Diddlebock) in their entirety. After the first 10 minutes a simplemindedness takes over Sullivan's Travels that make makes it a dispiriting film.

	Peter Segal's ""Anger Management"" is a film with nothing going for it.  It is best described as boring, annoying, and devoid of laughs.

Mild-mannered Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding.  He immediately develops a problematic relationship with Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the self-help expert leading the sessions.  As the two men spend more and more time together, Buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling.   

""Anger Management"" just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like.  It is essentially a one-joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly.  Sandler and Nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker.  Furthermore, the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings.

",0,"'I'm the guy in the freezer department who dials 911. I swear. """" Peter Segal's ""Anger Management"" is a film that doesn't work. This can best be described as boring, annoying and without a laugh. After an unfortunate misunderstanding, meek Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is sent to counseling to manage the anger. He immediately develops a problematic relationship with Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the self-help expert who leads the sessions. As the two men spend more and more time together, Buznik begins to wonder whether his counselor is the right person to advise. ""Anger Management"" simply doesn't get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like. It's essentially a film with a wit that consumes its effect very quickly.

1774,"	Groden continues his Conspiracy Theories in Spite of Evidence to the Contrary
	Robert Groden suggests that the Zapruder film of the Kennedy Assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of Kennedy.  In my opinion, his ""evidence"" is shaky at best.  Groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who ""really"" shot Kennedy, and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by ABC, CBS, and many books.  Groden needs to finally realize that the Kennedy assassination has been solved definitively, and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money cash-cow alive.  

Don't draw a conclusion based on this DVD!  Look at other sources listed below and then draw your conclusion:

1.  ABC's Peter Jennings presentation of the Kennedy Assassination (available on Amazon.com) clearly shows that Oswald was the one and only killer of JFK.
2.  CBS's Dan Rather's special program on the Kennedy Assassination (available on CBS website) also suggests that the preponderence of the evidence points to Oswald as the lone killer.  
3.  The book ""Case Closed"", by Gerald Posner.  He uses the physical evidence collected in Dallas, logic, and his ability to see through the fallicies of the conspiracies to show that Lee Oswald is the lone assassin.  
4.  The book ""Marina and Lee"", by Priscilla Johnson McMillian.  This book shows that Oswald was certainly capable of the assassination, and the circumstances of his life point to the conclusion that he killed Kennedy.  

My advice is to watch this DVD first, and then look at the sources I list above, and then make an intelligent conclusion.  If you are like me, you will see that Groden really has nothing solid to stand on.

1779,"	A nice idea turned to utter drivel by an incompetent production team.
	Poor Lindsay Lohan - it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life, she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off.  As an actress, she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft.  As a child actress, she was a natural fit for her spate of Disney appearances, with FREAKY FRIDAY her crowning achievment.  However, as a young adult, the pressure is much higher, as is the bar of success.  And movies like this are NOT helping.

But to be fair, one cannot place the blame on Ms. Lohan.  The fact is, she has already had a turn in a non-Disney role which paid off exquisitely.  MEAN GIRLS offered us the first glimpse of Lindsay in a post-Disney world.  The timing was on, the interaction with the cast was superb, and everything just fell into place.  But then again, that film also benefitted from a knockout script by a knockout writer (Tina Fey).  JUST MY LUCK has NONE of these things going for it.

Perhaps ironically, Ms. Lohan's latest vehicle is quite an unlucky choice for her.  We have a promising premise in the concept of a boy and girl with opposing luck.  Lohan is lucky, Chris Pine is not.  Inevitably through the courses of movie magic, we know that the two will end up trading places (much like Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd once did in . . . what was the name of that movie again?)  The only mystery for the viewer is whether this will occur through a wise old Asian or a wise old Gypsy. (Spoiler - it's the gypsy! OK, I know, I shouldn't be giving these things away!)  Like I said, we all know this is going to happen.  What we DIDN'T know was that it was going to take THIRTY-FIVE minutes to get there!  So, we kill one full third of the movie being bombarded with example after example of Lohan's good luck and Pine's bad luck.  By the time they make the switch, I had already lost interest and was planning my lunch.

After the predictable bout of sudden bad luck, Lohan learns that an ill-timed kiss with Mr. Pine was what caused the change of fortune.  Problem is, the kiss was at a masquerade party, and she doesn't know whom she kissed.  What follows is perhaps the film's only somewhat enjoyable sequence as Lohan tracks down and ambushes 20 strangers with sudden and embarassingly public kisses trying to get her luck back. 

Sadly, this brief bright spot ends too quickly, and it is back to the formula as Lohan and Pine meet and fall in love anyway, not knowing that they are the ones who caused each other's luck to change.  If predictable hook-ups make you happy, you might find some charm in this final third of the film - that is if you can overlook the sudden need for Lohan's best friend to become a song-writer in what was obviously a ""what do we do with the final act?"" tacked-on storyline with positively no set-up beforehand.

The problem with this film is that it comes across as very ""slapped-together"" (To borrow from Mad TV, it was ""JUST MADE IN TEN DAYS).  Is the director to blame?  While Donald Petrie has a few hits to his name (MISS CONGENIALTY, GRUMPY OLD MEN, and MYSTIC PIZZA) he also has more than a few duds (THE ASSOCIATE, WELCOME TO MOOSEPORT, MY FAVORITE MARTIAN).  

Or perhaps it is the writing team?  To date, the two credited writers have yet to muster up a single true hit, and one gets the sense that a more competent writing team would have taken a better direction with the plot and have not wasted the obvious talent that Ms. Lohan does in fact possess.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen the producers take a risk and make Lohan a much more loathsome character to begin with than she is.  Her character comes off as too nice to hate, and yet too shallow to root for.  

Whoever is to blame, this is clearly a sub-par effort at best, and one I hope Lindsay (or her casting agent) will learn from.  With four movies coming down the pike, she still has a shot at transitioning into a much more serious career.  I like that she has taken smaller ensemble roles recently (such as PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION and BOBBY).  A very smart play on her part.  Let's hope she can steer clear of JUST MY LUCK roles for awhile

	Death Tunnel began with promise. Early in the movie we were treated to some unique visuals, wonderful music, and a good feel. Them the actors opened their mouths and Death Tunnel fell apart.

Death Tunnel is the story of 5 college girls who, seeking an initiation into a party clique, are picked into a hazing ceremony which leads them to an old hospital where white plague victims were slaughtered. The building holds much more than they suspect, including angry (and dull!) ghosts. From here the madness ensues and the blood flows.

Death Tunnel drags after the first 30 minutes, and holds few frights. The story gets dull once the girls are trapped, for nothing really happens other than 45 minutes of filming tricks. During this time we are tortured with an abundance of horrible acting; some of the worst in an horror film I have seen this year. The acting leaves you scratching your head, wondering how any film studio will give a director/producer $2 million to make Death Tunnel and allow them to squander the money on junk talent.

And in the end, that is what kills Death Tunnel: pitiful acting. The acting is scary, the movie isn't. Run away from this stinker. Run very, very far away and don't look back.

1789,"	Unmemorable Except for the Leading Actors' Good Acting
	Kiefer Sutherland stars in `Dead Heat' a crime drama in which the star of hit TV series `24' can show more tender side of the character than he is often associated with. He plays Pally, 35-year-old Boston cop who is forced to retire because of the heart problem, and his acting is very good. Overall, however, there is not much that I can recommend in `Dead Heat' except some nice touch in showing the characters. The film tries to include as many things as possible, but few of them really materialize. 

The story looks rather like a familiar one. Because of his early retirement, Pally starts to drink, and even thinks of committing suicide. His relationship with his estranged wife Charlotte (Rhada Mitchell) is not going well and he is not happy to know that she is now going out with someone else. 

But Charlotte is also nice and caring, so she persuades Pally's brother Ray (Anthony LaPaglia) to visit him. Ray, who is accused of not being a law-abiding citizen by his too earnest brother, has a good plan to make money easily, and offers it to Pally. It is about buying a racehorse cheap, he says, and it is an easy job because he happens to know that the horse, which has not win any races recently, is actually misdiagnosed, only suffering from a polyp a small operation can remove. 

When everything is going well, things get suddenly complicated because of a gambling-addicted jockey Tony (Lothaire Bluteau). From here, the story snowballs into blackmail, caper and even murder, but the film's overall tone is always light, not taking itself very seriously. 

Unfortunately, for all their effective acting from Sutherland, LaPaglia, Mitchell, and Bluteau, the weak and unsure direction totally fails to give momentum to the otherwise unremarkable film. It is not funny when it tries to make us funny, and it is not romantic when it tries to be romantic. Feeble direction simply misses several good opportunities to make good use of the jockey's sullen little daughter Sam (Kay Panabaker, her feature debut), who could have been a little surprise (or gem) in this unconvincing plot.

It is true that Kiefer Sutherland shows in `Dead Heat' another side of acting talent, which is less eccentric and intense than most of the roles he had played, or he would play. That is good news, and the only good news here

1790,"	Low Quality Sword and Sandal Movie
	Delmer Daves' mediocre direction of the sequel to the equally pathetic film ""The Robe"" starring Richard Burton.  A totally contrived film that demonstrates no competence in either screenplay, direction, acting, or historical accuracy of any sort.  Avoid at all costs unless you're expecting to see it as a comedy.

Compared to Kubrik's incredible direction for 'Spartacus' a few years later, the gladiatorial scenes in this film are second rate. Even the low budget film 'Barabas' with Anthony Quinn had better direction than this worthless film.  The screenplay is contrived, the script is worthless, and the acting utterly shallow from everyone on this film: at least 'The Robe' had Richard Burton.  Victor Mature continues to act as if he just came out of a cocktail lounge after a few martinis too many.  Jay Robinson continues his idiotic and ridiculous performance of Caligula as if the character were a retarded bufoon instead of the diabolical genius of cruelty and perversion (See Hurt's performance in the BBC's 'I, Claudius' to see how a good actor handles this character.)  In short, reading the New Testament or going to a church sermon is far more entertaining and historically faithful than watching this garbage film.  Just the fact that Victor 'Manure' is in this film says it all.

Ignore this pathetic film and watch 'Spartacus', 'Barabas', or even the fantasized 'Gladiator' for some good Gladiatorial films.  As for Biblical films, 'Ben Hur', 'The Ten Commandments' or 'Quo Vadis' are films that are worth watching much more than this putrid Hollywood junk.

	The reason the original ""Iron Chef"" was such an awesome show was entirely due to the bad translation and over the top voice acting.  Therefore, without these elements, it becomes a pathetic charade of the original program.  

I was, at one time, a hardcore cult fan of ""Iron Chef"" because of the hilarious voice overs and true, foreign zest of Chairman Kaga and the gang.  I really didn't care much for the cooking or whatever food was being prepared.  The real heart of the show was the voiceovers and the mad, zesty zeal with which the Japanese chefs went over something as inane as cooking.  I loved ""Iron Chef"" in much the same way as I loved the original ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""  They were both quirky tv cult shows that gave a certain sense of community among their hardcore fans.  

This new show really doesn't cut it in any way, shape, or form.  I'm not being unpatriotic or anything, I'm just saying why this new show is so weak.  Also, I noticed that once the translators of the original show started figuring out the show was a huge hit, they ruined their own voiceacting by being all self concious.  The original few seasons of the first ""Iron Chef"" are where it's at!  Once again, I don't watch this show for the cooking, I watch it for the odd, bizarre translations and cheesy voiceacting

As if the plot matters (it doesn't), the movie is about a woman and her sister who use hubbie's computer to access chat rooms, etc, and witness online killings, and of course, see the killer in a sort of ""Eyes of Laura Mars"" style.

The two lead males are played by non-actor musicians Roger Daltrey and Huey Lewis.
Lead females are played by former actresses Natassia Kinsky and Nicolette Sheridan.
The killer is played by a still-unknown actor.

Major problems:

1. Talking computers (""electronic chronometer activated"").
2. People talking to computers as they type.
3. Never making a typo even when typing at an awkward angle and not looking at the keys (while talking to someone else).
4. Easy access to talking encrypted computer by using a microphone that you have to be an inch away from to use. And the computer selects only some of the words you say, as needed.
5. Really bad acting.
6. Un-sexy eroticism.
7. Over-technologized thoughout.

It might seem tempting to ""save"" 5 bucks, but you're wasting the other five dollars.

	The Award winning documentary Freestyle, looks like something fresh, creative, and new from the exterior. I was psyched to purchase this DVD the minute I heard about it. 

What a let down!

First of all, How did Freestyle achieve all of the acclaim and all of these film festival awards, Secondly who picked it as a winner? Probably some cornball who isn't familiar with the culture or good off the dome MCing?
This documentary tries really hard to connect to the audience and present the validity of rhyming off the dome but falls completely flat. The film isn't balanced enough to a certain degree. What you basically have is nothing more than a bunch of tree huggin backpackers spitting nothing but junk and 10 syllable words off the top of their heads for a majority of the film. Don't get me wrong there are some credible scenes in Freestyle with Mos Def, Biggie, Black Thought, J.U.I.C.E, and the Last Poets....but not enough.  Freestyle tries to come off as some profound documentary but sheds very little light to the subject and the questions that many Hip-Hop heads have asked for years. Why wasn't the current trend of fake freestyles (writtens coming off as freestyles) addressed more? Why weren't more credible MC's exposed and quality underground MC's presented? Why is there a section entitled ""written/freestyles"", what kind of oxymoron is that? It makes no sense. Why is there a section on Freestyle DJing??? What???!!!? Isn't that called turntabalism??? It seems as if they're fishing for more topics that ultimately don't have much of a direct relation to rhyming off the top. Is there a freestyle graffiti section too???
Freestlye continuously fails and derails itself off track from the key subject, the art of freestyling. At times it tries to be a Hip Hop 101 DVD. Most of the people who will be purchasing the DVD are already familiar with Hip Hop's roots in the South Bronx. Where is the quality freestyling at? Ultimately, ""Freestyle"" is over-saturated with un-proven, extremely weak, amateur MC's who need to focus more on spitting quality off the dome freestyles.
They cover Supernatural's sorry a$$ for almost half of the entire DVD, which is very unfortunate. I admire his creativity, but he sounds terrible. It's no wonder why he can't get signed. He thinks his doo-doo doesn't stink, because he's studied the dictionary to help expand his vocabulary for freestyling, but yet he can't take the time to concentrate on getting out of the broom closet that he lives in.
I thought that this film could have benefited from more footage of proven vets who can truly freestyle such as Kool Keith, Tribe, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-1, Snoop, Kurrupt, Common, Safir, Likwit Crew, Redman, or anyone from Hieroglyphics. These aforementioned artists can ""really"" freestyle. That would have faired much better than watching these tofu eatin, incense burnin, soy milk drinkin, poetry night geeks struggle to put words together. The Eminem rap Olympics footage from 1997 would have been great too.
Ultimately, if you are somewhat/vaguely familiar with Hip-Hop culture or a new fan of the underground scene, then you will love Freestyle.
If you consider your self a long-time fan of Hip Hop culture and familiar with the topic of freestyle rhyming then you will be somewhat disappointed, just like I was.
 If you want a quality Hip Hop DVD purchase check out ""The MC"", ""Scratch"" or ""Hip Hop Immortals"" take my word for it. I'm rating this with 2.5 stars mainly for the rare footage of artists such as Kool Moe Dee, Bahamadia, Biggie Smalls,  The Roots, Craig G, and Kool Herc

	What's all the fuss about. Ms. Hepburn doesn't act. Our leading man is plodding and mumbles half the time. Eddie Albert's restraint is utterly-unbelievable. Any two-bit paparazzi worth their weight in tin would have turned in those pictures for millions! What is Peck left with? A long life of knowing he's got a girl friend he can't touch, see, or speak with.

I find this movie depressing. Hepburn chooses the stifling life of a princess for the ""honor"", instead of following the man she loves and running down that empty corridor screaming out his name as he walks out at the end, having chucked the whole royal kit-and-kabootle for her man. 

Peck choose poverty instead of instant journalistic fame? Albert takes one for his buddy and is now stuck doing endless pin-up photos in his dank drab loft? 

I mean really people. Would you like to live with the staff at the palace? Endless ""League of Nations"" speeches, and all the time wondering what the man of your dreams is doing? I'm sure she'd face the fate of Lady Di trying to escape her monotonous life. And to think she may even risk marrying someone like Prince Charles, a stiff approved of by her entourage. Depressing. 

Peck is forever seeing what could have been as no one believes a word of what he says when he finally comes out with the truth on his deathbed. And the only source he has is the former pin-up photographer down the hall in the rest home, the one who constantly mutters at the ceiling, ""my photos coulda been a contenda"" while taking pictures of nurses with his 1950 pinhole camera, the one without film they let him keep for patient management sake.

Depressing. 

We should have heard a ""WAIT"" as Peck walks out of the last frame. Audrey running, her tiara falling to the marble floor, shoes flying off, holding her dress as the entire press corp chases after the both of them. They jump into the river again. Eddie, knowing she'd break, waits in a scooter and off they go into the roman sunset for a TRUE ROMAN HOLIDAY.

But NOOOOOOOOOOO.....

	Antonio Banderas plays a rich coffee magnate who is so stupid you can't believe he ever got wealthy when he's running around giving money freely to a woman (Angelina Jolie) who lied to him from the moment they met.  She didn't want him to be blinded by a pretty girl, so she sent a photo of the girl he was actually supposed to marry.  Well, we never get to see the pretty girl, because Jolie must have killed her too.  The only reason this woman is ""hot"" is because she'll take her clothes off and have sex with anybody (if you've seen Gia, you'll know what I mean).  Neither she or Banderas (who isn't a very good actor either and seems intent on overembellishing his accent) have any chemistry, and you wonder what he keeps forgiving her for when he catches up to her.  My guess?  The age old weakness most straight guys have for bad girls in bed, and all the sex in this movie gets old fast.  It's so stupid, because nobody has interludes like that unless they're shooting a blue movie.  The only blue here is the shade you will turn by the boredom with the weak plot.

You can see right through this silly waste of two hours you'll never get back:  this adaptation from Waltz into Darkness was remade especially for the purpose of exploiting two celebrities with highly sensual images and nothing more.  This movie is as bad as Showgirls and one star less than Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, because at least Beyond is badly funny in an entertaining way.

What a stupid name for a bad guy, but I guess it wouldn't make a difference even if his name was Ralph or Percival.

Early on in the movie, the so-called beauty Julia/Bonnie/I forget what else--wants to see a really bad theater group, and a friend of theirs comments on what a cheap mellowdrama is being presented.  My thoughts about Original Sin exactly.  The plot is stupid, and the dialogue is so bad it's over the top.  In the end, the movie makes absolutely no sense, and you wish you would get a payoff, but you don't.  The rat poison doesn't do its job, and neither does the executioner.  All I really am sure of is that, with all the rape scenes that Jolie's horrible character seems to enjoy and her portrayal of a woman who's asking for it constantly, that women should find this movie grossly offensive and degrading to our gender, and I'm not even a feminist!  As for studmuffin Banderas?  He really has no business in front of a camera because his acting scope is on par with the little boy who was in Problem Child with John Ritter.  However, he is a good director (Crazy in Alabama).  Heed my advice and avoid Original Sin; the two hours you waste on it will be unforgivable.
",0,"The only sin here is that I was stupid enough to sit through it. Antonio Banderas plays a wealthy coffee magnate who is so stupid that it's hard to believe he's ever become rich by walking around and giving money to a woman (Angelina Jolie) who has lied to him from the moment they met. She did not want him to be blinded by a pretty girl, so she sent him a photo of the girl he was supposed to marry. Well, we never see the pretty girl because Jolie must have killed her. The only reason this woman is ""hot"" is that she will undress and have sex with anyone (if you have seen Gia, you will know what I mean). Neither she nor Banderas (who is not a very good actor and wants to exaggerate his accent) have any chemistry, and you wonder what he forgives her for when he catches up with her. My guess? The age-old weakness of most straight men for bad girls in bed, and all the sex in this movie is getting old fast. It's so stupid because no one has interludes like that unless they're making a blue movie. The only blue here is the shadow that one gets from the boredom with the weak plot. You see through this silly waste of two hours that you never get back: this adaptation of Waltz into Darkness was remade especially for the purpose of exploiting two celebrities with highly sensitive images and nothing else. This film is as bad as showgirls and a star less than Beyond the Doll's House, because Beyond is at least entertainingly bad comic. Not only does their relationship lack a real sense of love, but you also get this overwhelming desire to see the creepy, unconvincing Billy (horribly played by Thomas Jane) get the girl. Billy? What a silly name for a villain, but I don't think it would make any difference even if he was called Ralph or Percival.

1832,"	English Soundtrack Version Vastly Inferior to the Hong Kong Original
	Can someone please tell me where to get the re-mastered DVD version of this film with Chinese audio and English subtitles?  The recent Hong Kong Legends release is crazy: Chinese audio, or English audio, but NO English subtitles!  

I have the original Chinese language/English subtitled (the subtitles are imbedded) version of this movie on a Universe VCD and, based on the merits of its available Chinese audio/English subtitles alone, it is a better movie--by magnitudes--than the one(s) commercially available to the (hapless) U.S. market.  

The English dubbing on this DVD, even though well synchronized with the actors' lips, takes so much away from the film nevertheless, especially its ""Chinese-ness,"" which is a major reason I enjoy this movie genre.  Take, for example, the scene where our hero first returns to Jing Woo School after learning of his master's death and sees First Senior fight a challenge match with a visiting master.  After handily defeating the challenger, First Senior actually saves face for the beaten master which the English soundtrack completely (and deplorably) misses.  Also, at the very end of the U.S. release film, Chen says he is going back to his Japanese girlfriend.  In the original, Hong Kong release, he actually goes off to fight the Japanese with the resistance movement.  Between these two examples, there are many such, gross audio mis-cues; enough, at least, to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film: the best of Jet Li's filmography, and perhaps the best of the ""modern"" Martial Arts genre, period.

The same criticism holds true for Jet Li's The Tai Chi Master (released in the U.S. as the English-dubbed Twin Warriors).  It's an English soundtrack superimposed over a Chinese movie, often stripping the film of its unique cultural content/identity/nuance, forcing the film through an American ""knock-down-shoot-'em-up"" template and reducing the potential for mental (as opposed to strictly visceral) enjoyment to a pitiful minimum.  We end up with a film typically devoid of humor, character development and silver screen ""intimacy,"" a film precariously out of balance with, and far flung from, its careful directorial intent.

If you value the full content--visible and audible--of Chinese martial arts films, but lack facility in the host language, then the next best thing is a well-subtitled, original language version.  And this release clearly is not that--by a long, long, long shot.
",0,"English soundtrack version significantly worse than the original from Hong Kong Can someone please tell me where to get the newly mastered DVD version of this movie with Chinese audio and English subtitles? The latest release of Hong Kong Legends is crazy: Chinese or English, but NO English subtitles! I have the original Chinese version with English subtitles (the subtitles are embedded) of this movie on a Universe VCD and just because of the advantages of the available Chinese audio / English subtitles it is a better film - in orders of magnitude - than the one commercially available on the (hapless) US market. The English dubbing on this DVD, although well matched with the lips of the actors, still takes so much away from the film, especially its ""Chinese"" side, which is a major reason why I enjoy this film genre. Take, for example, the scene in which our hero returns to Jing Woo School for the first time after the death of his master and sees First Senior contesting a challenge with a guest master. After a narrow victory over the challenger, First Senior actually preserves the face of the defeated master, which the English soundtrack misses completely (and regrettably). At the very end of the US movie, Chen says he is going back to his Japanese girlfriend. In the original version, released from Hong Kong, he actually goes to fight the Japanese with the resistance movement. Between these two examples there are many such gross sound errors; at least enough to take three stars away from an otherwise five-star martial arts film: the best of Jet Li's filmography and perhaps the best of the era of ""modern"" martial arts. The same criticism applies to Jet Li's The Tai Chi Master (released in the USA as the English dubbed Twin Warriors). It is an English soundtrack superimposed on a Chinese film that often takes away the film's unique cultural content / identity / nuance, forces the film through an American ""knock-down shoot"" em-up ""template, and reduces the potential for intellectual (as opposed to strictly visceral) enjoyment to a pitiful minimum. The end result is a film that typically does not have a sense of humour, character development or ""intimacy"" on the screen, a film that is dangerously out of balance and far from its careful direction. If you appreciate the full content - visible and audible - of Chinese martial arts films, but don't have a simplicity in the guest language, then the next best thing is a well-subtitled original version. And this release is clearly not that - far from it, long, long."

	Date Movie should be shown non-stop to all captured Al Qaeda prisoners - only mass-murdering terrorists deserve the kind of cruel and unusual punishment this film dishes out from start to finish.  Let me be perfectly clear about this: Date Movie may be the worst movie ever made; it's certainly the worst comedy ever even conceived of.  You may cry, you may scream, you may even go insane at the infinite stupidity of this film, but you will not laugh or grin or even smirk at the abysmal antics on display here - not once.  It doesn't matter if you get any of the jokes or recognize all of the films and other things being spoofed because this movie thoroughly blows chunks.  The only thing I got out of this movie was an awful headache.  If you ask me, everyone associated with this film should be banned from the entertainment industry for at least ten years - if not for life.  Had the first fish who ever crawled out of the water known that millions of years of evolution would give birth to Date Movie, he would have stayed in the ocean.  

Whatever happened to that sweet and charming girl we came to know during the first couple of years of Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  Why and how did it ever come to this: Alyson Hannigan humiliating herself in such raunchy, tasteless, unoriginal drivel?  She can still light up the screen with that smile of hers, and she certainly put a lot into her performance, but I'm embarrassed for her here.  She plays an overweight, very disgusting waitress from a mixed family (boy, is it mixed) who is desperate to find her Prince Charming.  After convincing Hitch (Tony Cox) to help her find love, she's given a complete overhaul (literally), plunked down into a reality dating show, and actually finds a man.  We watch them go through the dating stage, the meet the in-laws stage, and the wedding stage, encountering a number of obstacles to their future happiness.  Really, though, the story is unimportant; all the script cares about are stereotypes, clichï¿½s, toilet humor, and things that make you go yuck.  There's no joke too hackneyed, no visual too disgusting, and no dialogue too stupid to throw in the mix.

1851,"	It had potential; I'll give it that
	The last time I saw the names ""Adam Goldberg"" and ""Giovanni Ribisi"" together, they were two American Soldiers who perished while trying to save a certain Private Ryan.

Goldberg co-wrote and directed this contemporary psychological drama that has all the ingredients for a great finale but gets left in the oven too long.  At times towards the end I was thinking it could have been something perhaps similar to ""Memento"" or something of that nature.  What this film gives you is a plethora of cross analyzing ideas meshed with real time parallels, that ultimately bogs down in a mosh of messy execution.  Some of the biggest points and profound themes that it spends so much time getting to in a bizarre and confusingly intricate way are so simplistic they leave you yawning.  Despite a stellar cast that besides Rabisi also features Jason Lee, Christina Ricci, Vince Vaughn, Haylie Duff and Elvis Costello, it gets to far out of the main points of what it is trying to convey.

Rabisi stars as Gray Evans, a movie star actor who is having marital trouble.  Gray starts thinking amid his days of working on the set, going through fan email, and getting bugged by people, that a fan is stalking him.  Relentless in his obsession of this belief, he starts obsessing about others around him.  Great ideas here but then the film basically spends too much time zigzagging around to all the different characters and locales.  We understand that Gray seems to have a connection with a film grad who is also a fan and is suspected by him at one time, of being the stalker, but by the time 100 minutes roles by it gets to the point of not caring.  The ideas are there, I just feel it was a bit over ambitious in the portrayal of it all.  The sections that are supposed to be psychological really come off more like psycho confusing, and the parts that are to be rewarding in tying up loose ends towards the films finish end up falling flat.

If you like Independent films, or want to try something different, by all means give it a try.  I don't see it as being something I would watch again, or have in my collection for killing time on a Sunday afternoon with

Is she trying to drive the shrink nuts, or does she plan to kill him?

Although I am halfway done with this movie I think this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen and I am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where Christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing. I am done with this movie (believe it or not) and it only got worse: Christie's character Diana Scott marries an Italian man who hello, is old enough to be father! And oh yes, he's an aging prince (in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to Grace Kelly and what would happen to Jacqueline Kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her ""Princess Diana"" almost made me laugh). That nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my TV (a la Elvis Presley) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in ""Georgy Girl"" and that is spoiled British girl living in Swinging England marries older man (Three words: Anna Nicole Smith). Also, I would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that Christie deserved the Oscar for Best Actress? She didn't at all because it should (and I mean SHOULD) of gone to Julie Andrews for ""The Sound of Music"" (my pick for the best movie of the 1960's) because not only did she overtake her performance of ""Mary Poppins,"" for which she won the Oscar, she pulverized every performance by a female that year including Christie. And there's a problem with the Academy: They can't seem to pull the trigger in giving back-to-back Oscars to the same person.
 I'm not alone in this arugment: In Danny Perry's book ""Alternate Oscars"" he picks Andrews for Best Actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the AMPAS gave the Oscar to Christie was not because it was 'The British Invasion,' but they saw it as a way to give an Oscar to Christie's other film ""Doctor Zhivago"" which was T.S.O.M.'s rival and added to the fact that ""Zhivago"" had no acting nominations. There's another Oscar problem: They don't know when to be hip.
 Also, does it seem like Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey were the two worst actors in film history? Because it seems to me that every movie that I have seen with them are bad; weather it was this movie, or ""The Manchurian Candidate"" with Harvey, or ""Modesty Blaise"" with Bogarde.
 In conclusion, I think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an Oscar. Or as what Bogarde said to Christie: (a fitting way to close this review since that I end where it begins) ""I don't take taxis that are filled with whores!

	On the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama.

Underneath, however, the director seems to have a couple of other themes going. One thing that stood out to me is that the film is full of people who are ""caught between a rock and a hard place"". Right from the start, where Childers has to choose between following the rules of war or saving his best friend. He has a similar choice on the wall in Yemin - fire into the crowd or let the attack on his people continue. I think he knew at that moment that his career was in the crapper. Jones' character said as much during the trial: ""Whatever happens here, this man will never command marines again"". The ""bad guy"" national security advisor was in a bind: do what is best for America's interests or back up the colonel? The ambassador had to make a hard choice: lie on the stand or lose his job, his status, his reputation? Even his wife had to decide whether to tell the truth or stand behind her husband's story. Biggs, the prosecutor, got caught up in it - he started out with the intent to prosecute what he was convinced was a legitimate case, then got tossed a 'hot potato' by the NSA right in open court. Childers' second-in-command, Captain Lee, had to decide whether to tell the truth or back his colonel. And so on.

The court-martial itself seems to pit logic against emotion (shades of Star Trek!). The differences are clearest in the closing arguements - Biggs is the Joe Friday ""just the facts"" type; he presents the panel with A. this happened, then B this happened, and so on.  Hayes' whole arguement is based on emotion - and then, finally, the jury is left with yet another hard decision.

I found the movie very interesting in terms of what is going on with the characters - a lot of films are like this, if you look a little deeper, there's more there than the surface story.

1879,"	A Christmas Memory I'd rather forget.
	First off I do not dislike Adam Sandler, I rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film, not so much because I like raunchy antics, but because of the underlying message.  Adam Sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this.  You can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting, farting etc, but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him, he is loyal to his fans and to his friends.  Ever notice how he always gives jobs to Rob Schneider and Dana Carvey?  No one else does, that's a good friend, also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich, evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films.  He never sinks to there level either, perhaps that is why ECN was such a creepy, deeply disturbing film, I cannot, in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies,what was he thinking?  Early on in the film his character, a drunken loser, belches very loudly in a Chinese restaurant "" Ok I go take shower now"" says Chinese waiter.  I wanted to take a shower too, very soon after that scene.  For starters Mr. Sandler seems to  think he is a voice over man, he is not.  His idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard.  One can barely understand he is trying to do a character, and he barely is.  Also he is the voice of at least four of his characters, he is equally bad in each.  Perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house, he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something, he coaches the kids basketball team, he has been for years, and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him, he is simply there to be lovable, and put upon, he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face (as is the so-called humor here).  The script calls for Sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end, there is no real motivation for his bazaar, cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them.  He starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures, a menorah and a Christmas thing, I forget what it was.  He is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one, but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence, he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink, I can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads, surly, even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book.  Not here.  Of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go.  The film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous, mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a Japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms.  He goes to the basketball game and insults the children, ridiculing one boy for being fat, the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants ""nice kitty kitty"" he squeaks, what the???? then an angry father gets on Sandlers bad side (his only side) and is force fed a jock strap ""I hope you like them extra sweaty"" Ho Ho Ho.  For the next part of the film which seems like eight days, crazy or otherwise, his house is burned, he pushes his benefactor down a hill, in a porta potty which freezes feces on him, he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him, on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth.  We are treated to this twice.  God bless us, every one.  By the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs, each worse then the last, fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad  ""If I move my bowls without using the spray....that's a technical foul"" is one of few lines I remember, thank you God.  By reading this one might assume, as I did, that  this is irreverent in the good way, poking fun at old Christmas standards, but it is not.  It is disgusting, badly written, annoying and very, very cruel.  The two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly, for no good reason with no motivation or payoff, the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand, this is not always a bad thing.  Of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk, a childhood trauma involving a car crash on Hanukkah, he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after.  The same cannot be said for the audience.  Why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate, who is the audience?  There are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place, the over all feel of the film is one of depressed Sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness.  Adam Sandler has been loyal to his friends, his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was, even if it hurt his feelings.  This Christmas turkey won't even work as leftovers.  Bah Humbug

In this short segment there are a very few informal shots of the players that aren't in the film, but there are no deleted scenes in the normal usage of the term. Rather disappointing since the cast in audio commentary talks about seemingly dozens of neat scenes that ""hopefully will be in the DVD deleted scenes section.""
	Also, although the box promises ""2.35 wide screen,"" the film is pan-and-scan and only slightly letterboxed at about a 1.85 to 1 ratio. Some of the scenes are annoying because of the missing portion of the image.
	Also, it's not a gross teen comedy as the box copy suggests, more of a puppy-love romance with the ""four buddies"" comedy stuff as a sidebar. Which makes it potentially better, I guess, but it suffers from a lack of talent, especially in Ventimiglia's acting and in the writing. Very anemic; not much here.

Although the IMF had a leader (Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Peter Graves as Jim Phelps), there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective. A truly groundbreaking show.

Along comes Brain De Palma's catastrophe of a remake, starring that couch-jumping Scientologist Tom Cruise. Within half an hour of the film starting, the entire IMF team, save for Cruise, is killed off, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original Mission:Impossible is shot to hell. Granted, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are present as Cruise's new team, but Mission:Impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another Tom Cruise vehicle where he preens and postures. Making a film called Mission:Impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original TV series. It's obscene what Tom Cruise's ego has done to Bruce Geller's original concept.

",0,"John Woos first American film fails, but the action is good Action director John Woos first attempt at a good American action movie fails, with Jean Claude Van Damme (Bloodsport, Sudden Death) as the main character, who jumps over police cars, punches poisonous snakes in the head, balances on motorcycles, flips over a truck and lands on the ground... kicks a petrol tank on a man while he blows him up with a shotgun and puts a grenade in the pants of evil ass Lance Henriksen (Near Dark, The Terminator). Hey, when is Henriksen not a bad son of a whore? Yancy Butler (Drop Zone) is Van Damme's love interest, protecting her from the villains who try to kill him, and Wilfrod Brimley (TV's Walker, Texas Ranger) plays Van Damme's Southern uncle, who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow as he trots away after his country house is blown up. All in all, it won't be the worst movie ever made, its only presence, if the style John Woo brings to his action scenes... his power of speech in the art he creates.

- The Christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for Halloween than Christmas.  The part where Belle almost drowns (and would have certainly died of hypothermia) is a good example of this, though not the only example.

	This movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity.  The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement.  The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad.  One must think that it even disappointed it's original German viewers of the 1950's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era.  
As an anti-war film this film is a failure; as a shoot 'em up action war film it is droll.  All in all this is less satisfying than a made for TV movie of the same period.

	Many people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn't fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don't misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things.

	I love bad movies, so when i saw there was a documentary out all about ranking the worst movies i thought i'd give it a try.

Don't bother with this DVD.  Its 60 minutes long.  Now think about that fact. 50 movies, in 60 minutes. Some movies are barely shown for twenty seconds or they use a commercial that reveals little of whats bad in the movie.  SO problem number one they don't show enough of the movies.  Problem 2 is the bad designs of people booing and throwing popcorn at every movie they talk about.  The voice over was also a bit on the annoying side but thats probably the fault of the people who made this.

Its actually very ironic that this being about the worst films is actually a terrible film in itself. Another complaint i have is on what merrits on they ranking these films.  FOr a few, it seemed they put their not cause they were the worst movies made but because they were box office flops. I'm not saying Ishtar or Howard the duck were good movies but they shouldn't be placed on a list of the worst.  There are alot more terrible films, with acting thats unbelievably bad, mistakes galore, poor lighting, poor directing, poor writing,etc.  These were just bad movies that were flops.  I'm surprised they didn't throw Heaven's gate in here if they were doing flops.

So i don't get the criteria they were using.  A lot of really terrible movies were excluded too for some reason.  Manos is sadly missing.  Glen or Glenda is alot worse then Plan 9(despite plan 9 having the fame) yet plan 9 got a lower ranking.  

I guess the best thing i can say about this DVD is that they did get a list of some very bad movies.  Robot Monster and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians are amongst the worst movies you'll ever see.  According to the DVD, only Black Belt Jones is a movie so bad its funny but many (If not all) picked are so bad they are funny.  I didn't like how they included the movie Troll only because the sequel Troll 2 was so much worse(For heaven's sake, Troll 2 didn't even have trolls in it.  it had Goblins.  Thats bad!).

So, if you guys want to Watch a List of movies with barely any clips of the films that emphasize there baddness, this a film for you.  those of you who don't, heres a breif list of some of their movies.

	This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to ""Angel heart""). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo ""Delta"" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term ""special edition"" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series).

It is clearly made up of more than one original, with the Delta logo appearing in the lower right corner from time to time, but don't be fooled that it is the most complete version. The term ""special edition"" seems to refer only to the fact that it was published!!!!! Tony Curtis makes an incredibly bad intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night TV series). Don't buy it.

1921,"	Extremely good story but terrible picture quality
	I bought Orson Welles Citizen Kane and liked it so I decided to watch other Welles movies. I bought Mr. Arkadin because the DVD is cheap and rated high on IMDB. I should have buyed Touch of Evil instead. The quality of the picture is laughable, sometimes there are glitches in the sound during scene changes. Judging by the picture and sound quality I would say that they used equipment from the 30's to shoot and edit the movie and that the print used for that transfer was stored in a refrigerator during 45 years. Welles directing work is good but obviously he had to deal with the poor quality of the European movie industry of the 50's. Sometimes the picture shake, during the opening credits the captions are white on a white or gray background so we can't read everything. The editing is very poor, there are too many scene changes. When I bought this DVD I expected to receive the LaserLight version, instead I got a DVD made by Alpha Video. The case cover is different and there is no supplemental material. He was mastered cheaply on a PC with the SpruceUp DVD Maestro software, that seem to create problems, each time I try to play the disc on my computer the FBI warning message appear and then the disc eject.

1922,"	Wow-- it's impressive how much of a mess this is.
	The Weight of Water (Kathryn Bigelow, 2000)

This movie should have been a big production-- an adaptation of an Anita Shreve novel directed by Near Dark's Kathryn Bigelow, starring a handful of big-name actors. So why does it seem like a Lifetime Original Movie(TM) on steroids?

Jean Janes (Shadow of the Vampire's Catherine McCormack) is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the Isles of Shoals in 1873, when Louis Wagner (Rome's Ciaran Hinds) was convicted of the murders of two women and executed. Jean isn't sure they got the right person. She and her poet husband Thomas (Sean Penn) set off for the islands on a boat with Thomas' brother Rich (Josh Lucas, recently of Poseidon) and Rich's new girlfriend Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley, who went from this right on to film Bedazzled). The interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare, as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else, and the situation on the boat brings Jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime.

It's an interesting premise, and from everything I've heard it's carried off quite successfully in the book, which I haven't read. But oh, it doesn't work well at all in the film. The links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut; no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way. Most of the actors are wasted here; even the vastly talented McCormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self, while Sarah Polley, whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame, seems as if she's worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life. About the only actor who's really effective here is Hinds, who plays his role to the hilt.

It's not the worst movie I've seen in the past month, but it's pretty close. *

I can't say I dislike this item, but I did not like it either. Even though I'm still a novice golfer (score between 95-105) and been playing for about 18 months, I've read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other DVDs ...(yes I'm an instruction junky) and I can say that this instrutor (Simon Holmes) misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing, and even though I like how the DVD has a well structured lesson category listing, he does not explain deeply enough on many things.
The filming production seems to have a good intention for this DVD, but it lacks camera closeups/slowmotions on the ball, clubhead, ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want's to explain. I mean with today's technology on DVD production, this seems to be a cheap one.

THE GOOD
He has very good tips on many subjects that I think they're transparent for a very beginner.
If this is not your first instructional DVD, and just want to gather a new bunch of tips, then buy it. Otherwise a better selection that I can reccomend for a complete golf school DVD, is the Wally Armstrong's Ultimate Golfing Experience. The set is very cheap because it's a compilation of old '80s and 90'videos from that instructor, and from the 5 DVD's in the box, you can thrash 2 if you like, but for $17 bucks...HEY!! is worth it!

I hope this helps and saves you some money

	Unlike many, I hadn't seen this film when it first came out.  So it was with much anticipation that I recently sat down to watch it.  Well, it stunk.  What a disappointment.  The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue.  Show 'em how it's done, Leo.  

Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited.  Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief.  Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then.  Rutger Hauer is just plain bad.

In defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations.

Otherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations.

1934,"	Entertainment masked as stupidity?
	I'll get this out of the way: I never liked the 80's slasher films. Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it's a good kind of laughing for some reason.

Jason is in the future in a facility on a planet, except he escapes(of course). Disposing of scientists, including The Fly and Scanners director David Cronenberg, he ends up getting cryogenically frozen, along with another scientist. Flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out, ooh, a nice reward for Jason. As usual he comes to life and does what he does best: kill attractive looking hotties.

You don't go to these movies to expect well-written dialogue, character depth or anything, you come for the kills and to tell you the truth, they're slightly disappointing. Besides one kill, which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface, the kills are kind of been there/done that. It's basically stab here, impale there, it seems kind of unimaginative. A few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance.

Characters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are. However, Jason does what I'm starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls. One girl, wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off(off screen) and I'm like ""damn guy, let one cute girl live for once!"". Dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines. A self-deprecating parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced. ""We love premarital sex!"" is so classic, as well as ""it's okay, he just wanted his machete back!"". Granted they won't make an AFI list but they made me laugh. 

It's the kind of movie that you probably weren't supposed to like: it was ridiculous and dumb but boy did it seem fun. Just wish it was better

1935,"	The truth is, it's terrible.
	Jennifer Love Hewitt needs to fire her manager. I've yet to see her in a truly good role. Those terrible Know What You Did Last Summer movies, Garfield, Heartbreakers, If Only, and many others weren't exactly memorable roles. The Truth About Love doesn't help bump her in that direction either. Not that I was expecting Oscar-quality when I looked at the back of the box, seeing a picture of her in a leather corset, I wasn't going off of words to know that I was slightly interested in the movie. I've owned it for a few months now, and only recently got around to seeing it if only because my girlfriend watched it in the other room while my friend and I were in the other room playing games. She kept coming out every 5 minutes, and I could tell that she wasn't that interested. After giving in and watching it with her, I now wish we had all played Resident Evil 4 instead.

After what has to be one of the most annoying ""sweet"" introductions, we learn that a man has mailed a valentine letter to his friend's wife, Alice, supposedly by accident. Yeah, real smooth. When Alice gets it, she assumes it's from her husband, Sam, and sends him a hot letter as well. He gets it, thinking it's from another woman, and the problems ensue. He starts to hide the letter from her, and with that in mind, she tests his loyalty to her. She texts his phone anonymously with some of the dirtiest things Hewitt's done in recent memory. But as it turns out, Sam does have a mistress, and things get more complicated. You know what? The entire movie's boring up until 3/4 through. You're better off just reading the back of the box for the plot summary, then skipping to scene 9 or 10. And that's one of the cons I had with The Truth About Love- the time it takes to build up to what's an actually good conclusion with Sam's Anonymous admirer doesn't seem like it's worth it at first. But I'll admit, Alice's plan to bust Sam was a good one, though she gets a harsh slap of reality once everything's over.

The key problem with the movie is probably that it takes place in England, and Jennifer Love Hewitt's forced to take on one of the worst accents I've ever heard. There were a few times when I thought that they hired a voice actor to dub over her lines- it doesn't sound like her, and mouth movements often don't match lines. And that's funny considering the majority of the cast is from the UK. Then comes the unbelievable part about a guy cheating on a woman of Jennifer Love Hewitt's stature. There's no way in hell that could ever happen unless the guy is mentally challenged (ie- Carson Daly). The kicker is that Sam's mistress is a woman who looks to be in her 40s, and pales to Hewitt in any physical category. And how about that Archie guy? He's in 3 important scenes at most. All the other times we see him involve he and Sam's court room scenes which I have to say, are some of the most boring attempts at forced humor. In fact, the trial doesn't even have a connection to the central plot aside from showing that Sam and Archie are friends and partners. Alice's friend is also a complete hussy, and seems like she didn't make the cut of being on Sex and the City. Finally, guys, I'm sorry to tell you this, but there are no scenes of nudity here aside from when Alice visits an adult movie store. Though the best we get from Hewitt is her in a corset, it's only for a few collective seconds. The love scene is kind of laughable too when she's wearing that ridiculous wig. Even right now, I still have mixed feelings about the movie. Just when something completely stupid happens, something decent does right after it.

This is some of the worst picture quality I've seen in a while. The transfer looks terrible. Even watching it on my HD Monitor, there were tons of errors. Grain, artifacts, and something new. I almost want to call it rippling- many scenes are out of alignment, and we get a watery effect that takes over the entire picture. I can't explain it in full detail, but more or less, people's faces and bodies would look all twisted every couple of seconds. It stays for most of the first fifth of the movie, then is only occasional after that. But then there's blocking and many more problems that make up for it. You'd think with a direct to dvd release, they could at least get something right. The audio fares a little better, but everything's weird once again. While you can hear the audio just fine, it's almost too loud at times, and incredibly, all the actors' lines look like they're dubbed- especially Jennifer's. This becomes very obvious halfway through the movie when Archie yells at Sam. The camera is behind Archie so we can see the back of his head talking to Sam, but when he yells, his mouth doesn't open.

Special features? None. Though the box tries to claim that a chapter selection, previews, spanish subtitles, close captioning and Dolby 5.1 are special features, we all know better than to fall for that. At the very least I expected some behind the scenes interviews or something with everyone going on about how great it was to work on a movie bound for failure.

Is there any reason to buy The Truth About Love? Not at all. I guess that phrase ""low expectations lead to better results"" does ring true for it. I just wish the director, writers and actors had put a little more effort into everything. But you know the funny thing? I'll bet twenty bucks that this thing gets remade in a year or two with A-list actors (sorry Jennifer), and finds success after they rewrite all the boring parts. Even as a date movie, there are many better ones out there. Might I suggest Shaun of the Dead

Ben Stiller's character, a cross between Zoolander and Dodgeball (both are amazing films), was unexpectedly plain and bland. As for the rest of the cast, this film doesn't seem to be their thing.

	A friend and I tried watching this film once again recently, but still we both find it irritating and unpleasant.  From the beginning, when Katharine Hepburn's character destroys other people's cars without a care, we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny.  The acting is fine, as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant.  But the characters are not sympathetic, fun or interesting.  Grant's character is an unassertive, spineless person who is easily dominated.  Hepburn's character is blindly selfish. Who could care what happens to them?  The one interesting element is the acting that is done in proximity to a live leopard.

	Let me start off by saying that I am a HUGE MADtv fan and have been for years. It is easily my favorite show of all time. While I loved ""The Complete Season 1"" released in 2004, I think this DVD set is terrible. Why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent, and arguably the worst, seasons makes no sense to me. Of course this does have some classic sketches, impressions and characters on it, such as Debra Wilson's Oprah and Mo Collins' Lorraine, but a majority of it is just random. Most of these sketches aren't some of the better ones. Who picked this list?

Of course I'll still buy it because I love MADtv, but hopefully in time they'll go back to releasing complete seasons again. I can watch a better mix of sketches and episodes for free every day on Comedy Central

The film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice.  Sorry to bring up the obvious here, but the ONLY thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping.  He would not be pre-occupied with helping defend the police station (he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun); he would not be worried about ""his chances out there"" (remember he's on death row); he would be concerned only with escaping IMMEDIATELY.

	The Gauntlet may rank as one of Clint Eastwood's worst movies.  It is so unrealistic and silly I frankly didn't want to even finish it.  Released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and Dirty Harry movies, it stands out as being a real stinker.

Here Eastwood plays a loser of a cop, Ben Shockley, who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in Las Vegas for a trial.  He's told it's a ""nothing witness for a nothing case"" so he thinks it'll be an easy assignment.  Well, poor Shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness.  It seems some conspiracy is afoot.  The rest of the movie is Shockley, and his female witness, Gus Mally, running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes.  And plot is so ludicrously predictable it's pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is.

Unless you really, really like Clint Eastwood, this is one to forget.  I'll bet he wishes he could.

She has only two personas in the entire 7-year series and she constantly alternates between them, and they are both nauseating. First, vomit-inducing Compassion-face in which she puts on this phony 'caring' face and talks in a 'caring' gentle whisper. Two, tough-chick-face in which she puts on a hard-chick scowl and speaks in a deeper hard-chick voice that is not in the slightest bit believable. God she nauseates me. The same thing happened with Maggie Thatcher. The one time the dumbasses put a woman at the helm and she totally ruins everything. Unlike Kirk, Picard, Sisko and even Archer, Janeway has no charisma at all. Yuck. But shes not the only one, this has got to be the only Star Trek series in which no matter how hard I tried I could never develop any attachment to the characters. They're all boring. Only Paris has any appeal and even then not much. I watched the first 3 seasons hoping I would grow to like this garbage and finally gave up. Years later I finally came back and decided to give the final season a try in the hope that the characters might have developed over the years. No. The same old nauseating Janeway, same old boring episodes, spewing over with self-righteousness and endless lectures about human 'morality'. And this series is the most mushy, sentimental crap of all the Star Trek series. There is barely an episode that is not cringe-inducing in its emotional mushyness. The only moments in the entire seventh series that were worth watching was the 'Q2' episode and that was only because Q was in it (and they even turned that into a morality play), and the very end of 'Renaissance Man' when the Doctor tells Harry that his saxophone playing sounded like a wounded Targ.

There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place.

The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says ""IT HAS MOVED??"" yells ""SOIL IS MY POWER"" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over.
 That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot.
 This show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what I understand is not a big ""Final Fantasy"" demographic. 
 Strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it.
",0,"Worst anime TV show I've seen in a couple of years The only other FF material I've seen is the movie and I haven't played any of the games, so I don't refer to that in this report. After watching the first 3 DVDs and about 1 / 2 through the series, I can say for myself that this series sucked. The animation was bland and ugly. The C.G animation produced by GONZO was poor and did not fit in at all. (If you want good GONZO work, check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others). The act appeared to be aimed at children under 12. 2 children and an adult woman board a train in an abandoned station, which takes them to another world. There they meet a strange man (a very silent guy). Every episode goes like this. The children and the woman get out of the train in a strange place. The Villain (Child??) sends his minions to where they are. The man in black appears (about 7 min still in ep) and does nothing until the children are in real danger, then a light comes on his gun (attached to his arm) and he says ""IT HAS MOVED?"" screams ""EARTH IS MY POWER"" (cue a two-minute transformation sequence in which he lays and shoots 3 different coloured shells), a creature emerges from the smoke and defeats the villain, then he leaves. Then the children and the woman get back on the train and the show is over. That happens in every single episode and there's hardly any plot development."

	If you're a stoked surfer looking for a thrill, this is  quot;NOT quot; the video for you. However, if you want a training video on big wave surfing, go ahead. A better video for the stoke would be the classic Endless summer 2. Much more of a better buy. Billabong goes out of their way with a whole lot of explainations in Odyssey about tow-in surfing, training on watercrafts, and then they get to the surfing. I fell asleep throughout the 2/3 of it. I had to skip through half of it to get to the surfing. Nice documentary for Discovery Channel, not for the wired surf enthusiast. So

1967,"	Good film for LIEberals
	This is your typical film which replaces reality with fantasy. Something liberals like to impose on others. 

It flopped because it just doesn't have the ring of reality to it. You can have beautiful scenery, some decent actors (except the Ford-Lincoln-Mercury twit with his quasi-permanent ICE CUBE scowl) and then a really stupid storyline, whallah, you get the fantasy liberal worldview. In the movie the evil guys are an ex-militia leader and his band of neo-feudal toughs. The good guys are ""just-wanna-livers"" with their leader being a conman who found his destiny. LOL! Dumb, just plain dumb!

You realize it is the neo-liberals (no, I'm not pro neo-con either for the record, neo-cons are worse, getting others to do their fighting - cowards they are) who put limits on free speech, have eroded things so bad that I'm afraid a General Bethlehem type guy (minus the lunatic traits obviously) is the only way to fix things. Look to ancient Rome for the answers on this matter.

To be brief, the ""bad"" guys are liberals and neo-cons and the good guys are yet to make themselves known. This movie is right only in that America will split up and probably fall in some capacity. History shows the way, which our current bio-mass masquerading as humans will not understand nor can do anything about it (too busy playing video games and IM each other).

One lesson to be learned in the movie is this: might makes right. Here's another: all is fair in love and war.

	I have to say I had no expectations going into this movie, I watched it with an open mind, ready for anything. What I got was movie that not only managed to make me want to go to Wales, but also made me want to wail for hours because It was a waste of time. I am just confused about the whole thing really, the plot the characters the ending.....I see other reviews on here about how ""creepy"" it was, and I just didn't feel that. What I felt was an extreme hatred of the main woman played by Maria Bello (who I have never thought had a face or talent for acting) What they tried to do was take some made up legend of an otherworldly plane, where the dead go, and we can get the dead back if we give something living. The daughter is whisked away like Penelope taken to Hades but with much less interesting results. The mother and father, now have to take care of a displaced spirit child, her haunted freaky father, and a bunch of sheep that just need to be shorn and turned into a nice Ikea blanket for me.  Are we supposed to care for this mother who hits her daughter, goes out and parties to the extreme enough to where the father abandons his family to go live amongst the obviously naï¿½ve and gullible local folks? (Who worships in an abattoir? C'mon people) none of these folds deserved children, much less a ghost one. So when the mother realizes that she sucks, and decides to make the ultimate sacrifice to get her daughter out of underworld foster care I didn't really care, I was thinking the girl was much better off. I was also bothered by the girls attempted suicide and the fact that the father had no idea about it, what mother is so selfish that she keeps something so horrible from the father, because her daughter asked her too? Um, maybe what's wrong in this family is that No one communicates!!!!! Oh, wait, they all flipping know Morse code so that's enough?!?! There aren't any genuine scares, and sheep with glowing eyes aren't scary unless you happen to like eating lamb chops and feel guilty about it. The ending , both of them, didn't leave a good feeling or bad or even tie things all together, it felt rushed. I don't understand Hollywood's obsession right now with creepy children, it's an echo of the days of ""the bad seed"" and ""the omen"" but not homage, more like terrible copycats with no ""oomph"". So see this movie If you like Sean Bean, he is the only good thing about it, other than that see it to cheer when Maria Bello hurls herself off a cliff.

1983,"	The worst movie I've seen in the past 5 or 10 years
	Others have already described the movie; so I shall not repeat what has already said.
Dumont makes a movie, somewhat reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s ""road"" movies, in which a couple, gets in a car and drives off, to nowhere in particular. I hated those movies, but at least, in those movies the emotions the characters exhibited had some kind of rationale to it. Here the emotions are totally disconnected from reality, have nothing to do with what is going on in the screen, and seem only to be there to move the plot, if there is one, along.
Katia, the girl, who seems quite psycotic if you ask me, keeps getting angry for no reason whatsoever; for instance, she entices pair of dogs to follow their moving car, then gets p#$sed at her boyfriend, when he hits one of them. By the time the movie approaches its dismal end, I did not care anymore how the director was going to wrap it up. 
The DVD includes a ""Director's note of intent"" (always a bad sign) A mix of Felliniesque dialog, blended with Sun Tzu; not a good combination. At the end of the ""note of intent"" the director finishes with ""Envisage this film only in relation to the means employed and so only work from instinct""
Well, instinct will not get you a viewable movie; I don't think you could make a worse movie, if you were trying to achieve it. It is not the violence or sex, other movies have that but still have some redeeming values, photography, artistic creation. There is no redeeming value in this. Just a waste of the DVD plastic.

1988,"	Hey! You got your Charmed in my Smallville!
	Here we go again. Another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots. The differences between season 3 and this drivel are STAGGERING. 

They must have swapped out writers or something. How else do you explain the camera lingering on Lana Lang's MANY revealing showers for no reason? Let me say this as clearly as I can: Showing skin on Smallville doesn't work!! 

Good Points: Michael Rosenbaum is still the best Lex Luthor ever put on film. Sarah Carter as Alicia Baker is back! She's Clark Kent's interim girlfriend, like a psycho Lori Lemaris (who cares if she tried to slice n' dice Lana last season and it makes NO sense for Clark to be within 50 miles of her? I don't). There are two new supporting characters this time, Lois and, erm...Jason. I weep for Jensen Ackles. He's way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role. The way he takes a dumbly-inserted character like Lana's New Boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something. Erica Durance as Lois: EASILY the worst actress, and her lines don't help. I don't really mind, because Erica LOOKS like Lois, even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese grater-level annoyance. I think Lois would work better if she just STAYED in Metropolis and we saw her only through Chloe. But I guess it's cheaper to keep her on the regular set. Personally I think it's a conspiracy to give Allison Mack less screen time. Why doesn't she get a revealing shower? Bah.

****THINGS THAT MAKE MY BRAIN HURT:****
1.)  Clark (somehow) becomes a quarterback for the football team. You get to see it for five episodes. What drama. Ok, this is just stupid. He's CHEATING, OK?? It's CHEATING. He can't just switch off his powers when he wants to. Clark's football career also results in the episode ""Recruit"", which is hazardous to your health.
2.)  Turns out Lana's part-witch. I thought she was Native American? Nah, just French. And a CRINGE-worthy villain.
3.)  PRODUCER: ""Hey, doesn't this show remind you of Charmed?? WRITER: ""Not really, but great idea!! Lets dress Lois, Lana, and Chloe is corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers!""
4.)  If the writers weren't going to keep Jason around for more than one season, why put him in the credits?? Durr. 
5.)  Jane Seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in TV history. She does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck. Bye.
6.)  'Jynx', 'Spell', 'Recruit', 'Sacred', 'Spirit' and 'Ageless'. Oh right, and 'Forever'. ALL LAME! They make me ashamed to watch the show! Some are so awful I don't think I've ever watched them more than once. That's like HALF the dvd set. Bah.

Oooohh, I wonder if Clark and Lana are gonna get together this season! Just they like get together and break up EVERY season! I'm on pins and needles!

The ONLY things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes. Oh yeah, Hey writers, stop ripping off other successful shows and movies! Morons

1989,"	The worst Best Picture winner ever???
	First off, let me explain why I purchased the AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS DVD in the first place, sight unseen.  One, I was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950's as I could on DVD, to add to my personal library.  Two, it was the winner of the 1956 Best Picture Oscar (how bad could it be, right?).  And third, it was on sale at my local wholesaler.  So I figured, what the hey, I'll take a chance.

Talk about a COLOSSAL disappointment.  I'm a huge movie buff.  I'm only 32 years old, but I love all sorts of films and genres from different periods and countries.  I love old black   white and silent films, and I don't shy away from foreign films either.  I'm also a huge fan of Warner Brothers' 2-Disc Special Edition DVDs.  I try to keep an open mind about all the films I see, but I just can't come up with any convincing arguments to either buy or watch this film/DVD.

To start, there is NO GOOD REASON why this film should be 3 hours long.  It could have very easily been edited down to 2, if not 90 minutes.  There is almost no script to speak of, and what little there is consists of trite exchanges and banter with barely 2 memorable lines of dialogue.  There are endless shots of open seas or country, followed by about 30 seconds of dialogue, followed by EVEN MORE endless footage of different locales.  There is no real drama or comedy going on to drive the film, and the pacing is absolutely DREADFUL... I found myself hitting the ""fast-foward"" button on my remote on more than a few occasions, simply because I knew I wasn't missing any dialogue and the establishing shots would go on for 1 or 2 minutes STRAIGHT!

Secondly, the entire cast is virtually wasted.  David Niven is always a delight to watch, but is never given a chance to make Fogg truly shine.  He has one demeanor that he holds throughout:  stiff and mannered, with little or no variation.  Cantinflas, who supposedly was one of the highest paid comedians in the world at the time 80 DAYS was produced, gives us little reason to believe how or why he was such a sensation (other than doing his own stunt work).  He's mildly amusing at best, and his accent is so thick and mumbled that I had to rewind and replay some scenes with the ""subtitle"" button on.  As for the ""noted"" cameos... again, the actors/comedians are given little to do and barely play to their strengths and familiarity.  The only cameo actor who stuck out as having any real performance or impact was the great John Carradine (can't miss that voice!).

It's hard to believe it took THREE different writers to come up with such a frustratingly bland, lifeless and unfunny script (not to mention headscratchingly illogical... when Cantinflas rescues the Shirley MacLaine Princess character, wouldn't she fall in love with HIM, her actual rescuer, rather than the cool and distant Fogg, who only ordered the rescue?  Talk about a missed opportunity for some genuine comedy!).

Although this film obviously has some fans, I wonder if it's only because of some overriding nostalgia factor, whether it was seeing it for the first time back in 1956 or on TV as a child.  Other than that, I can't understand how anyone could seriously recommend this film.  Yes, it's beautifully photographed, and the costumes are great, but THAT'S IT.  I can't believe that 80 DAYS won the Best Picture Oscar of 1956, a year that also gave us GIANT, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE KING AND I, THE SEARCHERS... hell, even FORBIDDEN PLANET or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS should have won before this overblown moving postcard.

I'm sorry to say that I probably won't bother watching this film again and will most likely end up reselling my DVD copy (if anyone will take it!).  Certainly my most disappointing DVD purchase EVER.  Don't say you weren't warned!

	Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors, thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating. But this film showed two desperate, middle-aged strangers (with all their flaws abundantly clear) meeting once a week for no-strings-attached encounters. The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the ""desperate"", tawdry, pathetic feel of their relationship. Naturally, one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner, one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters: sooner or later, anonymity is not good enough anymore.
